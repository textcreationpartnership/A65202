            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>MAny are thoſe Excellent Obſervations, and Inſtructive Admonitions, that might be drawn from the following Sheets; but leſt the Men ſhould take amiſs my going about to deſcant upon their Follies, and the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men be offended with me for unfolding the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cana</hi>'s of their Empire; the Reader is left to make his own Reflexions himſelf. I am none of thoſe Enthuſiaſt's who dream of Fifth Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies, but I cannot tell what to think of it, when I find the Women in ſo fair a way to erect One. Some perhaps there are, who may think theſe Stories Fabulous, but ſuch Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple diſplay their Ignorance. For certain it is, that in the Main, theſe ſhort Stories agree exactly with what they call the <hi>Truth of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory:</hi> and as for the Circumſtances which are added, they may be juſtly thought rather to illuſtrate the Stories, and diſcover the Cauſes of thoſe odd Events, which others only barely and obſcurely relate. For example,
<pb facs="tcp:53606:3"/>
'tis aſſuredly true, that a Prince committed ſuch and ſuch miſcarriages, that ſuch and ſuch Perſons of no Worth or Merit were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to high Prefern<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

But here the Riddle is unfolded. Let no Man therefore cenſure that for fabulous, which in the leaſt he cannot taxe, to ſavour either of Romance or Improbability.</p>

But being a wanton, as ſhe was, ſhe could not be content with one ſingle, tho' ſo noble a Conqueſt: She would be continually enſnaring with her purloining glances, all that were ſo daring as to ſeek their Thraldom in her looks, <hi>Marconefe,</hi> who was no leſs Beautiful, nor no leſs witty then her Siſter, tho' more reſerv'd Stomack'd a preferment, that ſeem'd ſo injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to her. However for ſome time ſhe ſtifled her Vexation in her Breaſt, not breaking her mind to any perſon whatever: But when ſhe ſaw the <hi>Meroflede</hi> let her ſelf looſe to others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the King, ſhe diſcover'd her Infidelity to him, after ſo diſcreet and ſo ingenious a manner, as if her intention had been only for her ſiſters ſake to reform the Errors of her ill conduct. On the otherſide, <hi>Cherebert</hi> lodg'd in <hi>Marconefe</hi>'s Breaſt, all his vexations and ſorrows for <hi>Merofledes</hi> wanton, and no leſs wandring hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and found ſo much Judgment in her ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments and her councils, that he thought he might be far more happy with her, then with her Siſter; and therefore he attempted to gain her affection, wherein the ſpeed of his ſucceſs was anſwerable to the eagerneſs of his purſuit. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conefe</hi> ſpar'd for nothing, for indeed, her emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53606:12"/> was ſo great to deprive her ſiſter of <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rebert</hi>'s Heart, that ſhe prevented his deſires, to the end, ſhe might compaſs her ends. <hi>Meroflede</hi> on the other ſide, was ſoon ſenſible of this alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and did all ſhe could to regain his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. <hi>Cherebert</hi> gave ear to her reproaches, bore 'em patiently, and endeavour'd to juſtify himſelf; and finding charms in both, unwilling to looſe either, he made it his buſineſs to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade one Siſter that he was intirely devoted to her; and the other, that ſhe was the only Miſtreſs of his affection.</p>
                  <p>All this while he was ſo enthral'd to his paſſion for theſe two Ladies, that he neglected the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of his Dominions, and altogether ſlighted <hi>Ingoberge.</hi> And ſhe, unfortunate Queen, acknowledg'd ſoon the fault, ſhe had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in drawing off the King from the pleaſure of Hunting, to make him ſenſible of amorous delights, and found her ſelf more unhappy then ſhe was when the King forſook her company, only to wage War againſt the wild Beaſts of the Foreſt. So that after ſhe had in vain attempted to reclaim him by her careſſes and her complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance, ſhe had recourſe to St. <hi>Germain,</hi> at that time Biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> who had gain'd a high repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation for his piety, and begg'd of him to lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King the wrong he did her, in making her ſuch ill returns of her kindneſs. But the remonſtrances of that Prelate, were ſo far from moving him, that they rather ſerv'd to render the Perſon of <hi>Ingoberge</hi> more hateful to him. For from that time forward, he look't upon her
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53606:13"/> only as a jealous Woman, that ſought to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt his pleaſures, and whoſe revenge was to be dreaded, ſo that he redoubl'd his ſcorn of her, and oblig'd her to retire into a Convent. After the Queen's retirement, the jealouſie of ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion intermixing with that of Love, the two Siſters were emulous each to poſſeſs, alone, the King's inclinations, and diſpoſe of all his Favours; and their embitterment augmented to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that it enrag'd 'em to a quarrel, which made a great noiſe and divided all the Court. The King in vain endeavour'd to reconcile and perſwade 'em to live peaceably together, at leaſt to keep an outward correſpondence of civility, if they could not love each other as ſiſters. But at length diſhearten'd by their tranſportments, and deſpairing of doing any good, he ſell again to his old ſport of Hunting, and left 'em at lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to quarrel among themſelves.</p>
                  <p>One day, being ſeparated from his Train, and very Thirſty,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Anno</hi> 524.</note> he alighted cloſe by a Fountain, for want of a glaſs he took up the Water with the hollow of his hand, at what time a young Shepherdeſs perceiving him, drew near him and preſented him an earthen Cup. The King took it, and obſerving in her Face, all the agreements of proportion and colour that Nature could af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, without the help of Art, he ask'd her name, to which ſhe anſwer'd, that her name was <hi>Dandelind,</hi> and that ſhe was a Farmers Daughter, who had a Houſe hard by adjoyning. Upon that, <hi>Cherbert</hi> declared who he was, and told her withal, that he would carry her to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53606:13"/> Court, ſhe excus'd her felf with an ingenuity that charm'd him, alledging that Obedience and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which ſhe ow'd her Father; and the Grief it would be to her to live abſented from him. Goe then, and fetch him hither, reply'd the King, and I will carry, ye along with me both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Immediately away ran the Shepherdeſs, and ſoon after return'd with the Peaſant, whom ſhe call'd her Father. Preſently the good old Man, who underſtood by his Daughter, that it was the King who ſent for him, ſell at his Feet, and begg'd to know his pleaſure. 'Tis my pleaſure, reply'd the King, to make your For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and your Daughter Happy: come to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row morning to me, when I riſe. The Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man fail'd not to attend upon him, and he made him Keeper of his Palace. Nor did the King believe he ſhould meet with any reluctancy in the Shepherdeſs; but ſhe ſhew'd him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But in that Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, <hi>Chilperic</hi> met not with thoſe ſweets of Wedlock which he expected <hi>Galſuiud</hi> was proud and haughty, as all the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are, and not of a humour to brook that her Husband ſhould, ſhare-with another Heart, and that affection which ſhe believ'd to be only due to her ſelf: ſhe ſoon perceiv'd the Love which her unfaithful Husband had for <hi>Fredegond,</hi> and diſplay'd her reſentment with a vengeance. <hi>Chilperic,</hi> accuſtom'd only to the patience of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donaire,</hi> could not ſubmit himſelf to <hi>Galſuinds</hi> outragious tranſports, and <hi>Fredegond</hi> left nothing omitted to exaſperate the King againſt her. For in regard ſhe beheld her certain ruin before her Eyes, unleſs ſhe ruin'd the Queen, ſhe never bog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled at the taking a reſolution to prevent her, and ſhe underſtood ſo well how to make the beſt of the ſhallow feebleneſses of which the King had given her ſuch frequent marks, that ſhe perſwaded him to make away <hi>Galſuind.</hi> Thereupon, <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peric,</hi> after he had fully reſolv'd upon it, made a ſhew of more then uſual complyance with the Queen's humour, and never viſited <hi>Fredegond,</hi> but withal the precautions imaginable, that he might take from <hi>Galſuind,</hi> all occaſion of miſtruſt, and when he found her quite cur'd of all her jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſuſpitions, one night that he was in Bed with

                     <hi>Sigebert</hi> being inform'd of the Death of his Siſter in Law, thought it his duty to revenge it, and layd the deſign without ever conſidering that the Murderer was his Brother. He engag'd alſo <hi>Gontran</hi> to joyn with him. On the other ſide, <hi>Chilperic</hi> rais'd an Army to defend himſelf; but before he took the Field, he Marry'd <hi>Fredegund.</hi> However, he did not prove ſucceſsful in that War, for that his Army being defeated, and his eldeſt Son <hi>Theodebert</hi> having loſt his Life in the Battel, he himſelf made a hard ſhift to eſcape to Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay, where <hi>Sigebert</hi> immediately beſieg'd him.

And tho' there were a Thouſand reaſons to have juſtify'd the conduct of that Prince, <hi>Chilperic</hi> believ'd him guilty, becauſe <hi>Fredegond</hi> accus'd him, and therefore after he had caus'd his Head to be ſhav'd, ſhut him up in a Cloiſter. But the cruel Queen was not ſatisfy'd with that puniſhment, which was not deem'd ſevere enough,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53606:19"/> for an imaginary crime: and rightly judging, that ſhe could not ſecure the Crown to her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſo long as <hi>Audouair</hi>'s Offspring remain'd alive, ſhe thought it behov'd her to ſend them out of the World. Therefore, to bring this to pass, 'twas requiſite to engage <hi>Meroveus</hi> in ſome new exploit by which he might incurr his Fathers farther indignation. For which purpoſe, ſhe ſent <hi>Gontran Boſor,</hi> who was wholly devoted to her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, to diſcourſe him in the Monaſtery. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently the Young Prince know him, becauſe he had ſeen him at the head of <hi>Sigebert</hi>'s Armies, but he was ignorant of the ſecret engagements between him and his Mother in Law; ſo that he eaſily fell into the ſnare which the traytor had laid for him, who propos'd to him, his leaving the Convent to head a party that he had ready to embody under his Banners, and to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, gave him an opportunity to make his eſcape. But no ſooner was he arriv'd at the place appointed, but he was aſſaſſinated by the very perſon into whoſe arms he had thrown himſelf, for protection. Which <hi>Chilperic</hi> look't upon as a great piece of ſervice, as being miſinform'd, and not underſtanding the depth of the affair.</p>
                  <p>There remain'd now no more then <hi>Clovis,</hi>

But Heaven, that would not permit her to enjoy the fruit of ſo many crimes, in leſs then ſix Months ſwept away all the three Children ſhe had by <hi>Chilperic,</hi> with the Peſtilence. So that the King not having any
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53606:19"/> more Children then <hi>Clovis,</hi> plac'd all his affections upon him, and conſequently render'd him more odious to <hi>Fredegond.</hi> Nor did the Young Prince leſs mortally hate his Mother in Law; and tho' it highly conccern'd him to conceal his ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which otherwiſe might prove his bane, yet could he not forbear to entruſt his ſecret thoughts with one of her Maids of Honour, with whom he had an intreague. So that as Lovers can keep nothing hid from their Miſtreſſes, he told her one day, that if he ever came to the Crown, he would not leave the Death of his Brothers unreveng'd, and that he would extend the puniſhment of <hi>Fredegond</hi> to the utmoſt ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor of the Law. This ſevere language being reported to <hi>Fredegond,</hi> as ſhe had great reaſon to, fear the dire effects of it, ſo ſhe made it her buſineſs to prevent her Son in Law: And to that purpoſe, ſhe accus'd <hi>Clovis</hi> to his Father, for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing destroy'd the three Children born of their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy's in lawfull Wedlock, by vertue of certain charms, compos'd by one of her Maids of Honour and her Daughter, the very ſame perſon in whom the Prince had put ſo dangerous a confidence. Thereupon the King, falling into the ſnare, tho' ſo palpable and obvious to the ſight, caus'd the two unfortunate Lady's to be arreſted; who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put to the Rack, that they might free them-from from torment, whatever was ask'd 'em, they confeſt not only all, but more then was ſufficient for the conviction of <hi>Clovis.</hi> So that the King, after he had ſeen the verbal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the depoſitions, commanded <hi>Didier</hi> and <hi>Boſon,</hi> the Captains of his Guards and <hi>Fredegond's</hi>
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:53606:20"/> creatures, to ſeize the perſon of his Son; which was preſently done with more then ordinary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanity. Immediately by order of the King his Father, they carry'd the Prince to <hi>Chelles,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Noiſy,</hi> beyond the <hi>Marne,</hi> where they ſtab'd him, and upon their return perſwaded the King, that he layd violent hands upon himſelf, to avoid the deſerved puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his crime. Some few Days after, the Maid of Honour and her Daughter were ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenc'd to be burnt alive, and accordingly Executed in the publick Market place of <hi>Paris.</hi> Nor did the cruelties of <hi>Fredegond</hi> ſtop there. For being afraid leaſt any one ſhould remain alive, that might revenge the Death of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny innocents, ſhe ſent in like manner to the other World, both <hi>Andouoire</hi> and <hi>Baſina</hi> her Daughter; altho that, being ſhut up in a Cloiſter, they were not in a condition to give her any occaſion of jealouſy. And now there was nothing wanting more, to ſatisfy the ambition of this remorſteſs Princeſs, but to have a ſucceſſor to <hi>Chilperic</hi> born of her own body. Propitious Heaven alſo, not yet reſolv'd to puniſh her transgreſſions, gave her one who was call'd <hi>Clotaire,</hi> in whoſe perſon <hi>France</hi> being once more reunited, was never ſince divided again.</p>
                  <p>But neither was Cruelty <hi>Fredegond</hi>'s only vice; for her unchaſtity was no leſs; and ſeveral Lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers had a ſhare in her favour, among which were <hi>Didier</hi> and <hi>Boſon</hi> already mention'd, and <hi>Beleran,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Bourdeaux.</hi> But he who enjoy'd her Heart the longeſt, was <hi>Landry de la Tour,</hi> Mayor of the Palace, who being both

The King ſurpriz'd at ſuch an amourous and familiar piece of merriment, ſlipt out of the chamber agen, without ſo much as one word, leaving <hi>Fredegond,</hi> who was become terrible of her mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, in a moſt terrible aſtoniſhment, and the leſs he ſeem'd to take notice of it, the more did the jealous Princeſs believe ſhe had reaſon to be afraid, as making no queſtion, but ſhe ſhould ſoon feel the effects of his revenge. By this time
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53606:21"/> 
                     <hi>Chilperic</hi> was got a Horſeback agen, and gone to find out his retinue, who were not yet return'd. And <hi>Fredegond</hi> made uſe of that interval of time, to reſolve upon what ſhe had to do, in ſuch a nice and delicate conjuncture. Immediately ſhe ſent for <hi>Landry,</hi> and having told him what had befallen her, ask'd his advice what courſe to take. <hi>Landry</hi> advis'd her to retire forthwith to <hi>Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tran,</hi> and to put her ſelf under his protection. The Queen beholding him with Eyes, which, tho' full of wiſtfull paſſion, yet darted forth ſome certain mixtures of deſpite, For a Knight, ſaid ſhe, like you, that have acquir'd ſome repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation by your courage, the reſolution which you would infuſe unto me, is nothing generous. As much a Woman as I am, let me take my own courſe. <hi>Chilperie</hi> muſt die, or we are both ruin'd; nor have we minute to looſe upon this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He is gone a hunting with a very ſmall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance: either then reſolve to ſend him out of the World, or to drop your head upon a Scaffold. <hi>Landry</hi> ſtood a while like one in a trance at ſuch a deſparate propoſal; but a length after he had ponder'd for ſome few minutes, with a fix'd reſolution, he ſhall die, Madam, ſaid he, and you ſhall be obey'd. At the ſame time he flung out of the Chamber without ſpeaking a word more, and being return'd home, he ſent for ſix undaunted Ruffians, that feat'd no colours, and whom he knew to be entirely devoted to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, to whom he unfolded his deſign, and having furniſh'd 'em with the beſt Horſes in his stable, and Money in their Pockets to make
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53606:21"/> their eſcapes, which way they thought moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, he directed 'em to the place where the King was a Hunting. Away flew the appoſted villains like Lightning, dog'd the King all the remainder of the Day, and keeping cloſe up with him by the favour of the Dusk, till he was got all alone into a ſolitary Village, there they gave him ſeveral mortal Wounds, and flung themſelves into the Forreſt adioyning. <hi>Fredegond</hi> underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the buſineſs was done, put her ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the protection of the Biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> and after that, ſent to <hi>Guntran,</hi> to offer him the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency of her Kingdom, and the education of her Son; who accepted both, adn undertook to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend 'em againſt <hi>Childebert</hi> and his Mother <hi>Brune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baut,</hi> who reſolv'd to diſpute the Crown with Young <hi>Clotaire.

                  <p>TOward the end of the Firſt Race, the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Kings gave themſelves up in ſuch a manner, to their Pleaſures, that they left the care of the Government ſo entirely to their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jors, that they never medl'd with Publick Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. <hi>Pepin</hi> exercis'd that Dignity under the Reign of <hi>Childebert</hi> II. He was one of thoſe Great Genius's that Heaven ſeem'd to have rais'd, for no other reaſon, then to Command others. All the <hi>French</hi> had ſo great a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence for him, that they lookt upon his Will and Commands, as ſo many Oracles. 'Tis true, that his Virtues render'd him extreamly worthy of that abſolute Power to which he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd. He was an enemy to Sloth and Effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minacy, and during the firſt year of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, he ſeem'd to be inſenſible of Love. He had always liv'd in great Reputation with <hi>Plectrude</hi> his Wife, thô ſhe were ſomewhat ſtricken in years, and of an imperious Humour. But there are certain Minutes, when the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Heroes ſuffer themſelves to be ſurpriz'd by
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53606:24"/> that dangerous Paſſion, which equals 'em with other Men. A <hi>French</hi> Lord, whoſe Name was <hi>Dodon,</hi> had had a quarrel with one of his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, and had kill'd him. Upon which, the kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of the Perſon ſlain, proſecuted him with great fervency: and according to all outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, he dould not have avoided ſuffering the extremity of the Law, unleſs he obtain'd the King's Pardon; which his Siſter <hi>Alpayde</hi> went to beg of <hi>Pepin.</hi> This Lady was one of the moſt amiable Perſons in the Kingdom, and her Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and Deportment were ſo engaging, that 'twas a difficult thing to refuſe her whatever ſhe demanded. <hi>Pepin</hi> beheld her with Admiration, and felt, upon the ſight of her, ſomething that he had never been ſenſible of before. He up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided in private his own weakneſs; and was juſt going to ſend back. <hi>Alpayde,</hi> with the rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of one that ſcorn'd the Tiranny of Love. Nevertheleſs, he could not reſolve to loſe her for ever; and therefore, that he might have a pretence to ſee her again, he told he would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin the Informations, and that if the Fact were not very foul, but deſerv'd Pardon, he would grant it her Brother. After that he coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited ſcruples, ſtarted obſtacles, and at laſt, after he had been often waited on by <hi>Alpayde,</hi> he declar'd to her, that <hi>Dondon</hi>'s Life depended upon her complyances with his Affection. The Lady ſtood ſurpriz'd at his Diſcourſe, which was altogether unexpected; ſhe bluſh'd, and look'd pale. But at length, <hi>Pepin,</hi> accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied his Courtſhip, and his Propoſal, with ſuch

'Twas a great vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation to a Perſon of his Rank and Reputation, to ſee that ſuch Domeſtick Squabbles ſhould ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him the object of the Publick Lampoonry. Nevertheleſs, he could not quit <hi>Alpayde:</hi> and he believ'd it no leſs an unbecoming weakneſs, to ſacrifice her to his Wife becauſe ſhe made a noiſe. He therefore made uſe of the liberty which the <hi>French</hi> were wont to take at that time, which was, to repudiate their Wives, contrary to the Prohibitions of the Church and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Canons.

                     <hi>Foulques Rechin</hi> going to pay a viſit to <hi>Amaney,</hi> Lord of <hi>Montfort,</hi> and condole with him upon the death of his Mother, fell in love with his Siſter <hi>Bertrade.</hi> He left nothing omitted to procure her Affection, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſtay that he made at <hi>Montfort,</hi> and not being able to obtain any Favour from her, he reſolv'd to marry her, thô he were already mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd to <hi>Ermengard,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Archambaut,</hi> Lord of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> and that he had a Son by her, who was afterwards call'd <hi>Jeoffrey Martell.</hi> To which effect, he caus'd his Marriage with <hi>Ermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard</hi> to be declar'd null, under pretence of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near akin, and took <hi>Bertrade</hi> to Wife, by whom he had a Son that bore his Fathers Name, and who going to the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> was King of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> In the mean time <hi>Foulques Rechin</hi> having had a Quarrel with his Brother <hi>Jeoffrey,</hi> about ſharing the Succeſſion of their Father <hi>Foulques Nera,</hi> the conteſt came to a Battle near <hi>Brochelac,</hi> where <hi>Jeoffrey</hi> was overthrown, and taken priſoner, but took his being detain'd in
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53606:35"/> Priſon ſo hainouſly, that for meer vexation he run mad. Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> VII. being inform'd how hardly <hi>Foulques</hi> had us'd his Brother, and of the unlawfull Marriage which he had contracted with <hi>Bartrade,</hi> excommunicated him. <hi>Jeffery Martell,</hi> who by this time was arriv'd to years of matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, taking advantage of the excommunication thunder'd out againſt his Father, took Arms to revenge this Mothers Quarrel, and ſet his Uncle at liberty. <hi>Bertrade</hi> ſeeing her ſelf ſo dangerou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly threatn'd by the ambitious Youth, who was already become the head of a potent party, ſought which way to rid him out of the World, and caus'd him to be poyſon'd. Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> being dead, <hi>Foulques</hi> ſent Embaſſadors to <hi>Vrban</hi> VI. who ſucceeded him to obtain his abſolution; offering to ſet his Brother at Liberty, and to quit <hi>Bertrade.</hi> Upon which, the Pope empow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er'd <hi>Hugo</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Lion</hi> to take off the cenſure, provided the Count perform'd what he had promis'd.</p>

                     </hi> who appear'd to him moſt charmingly beautiful notwithſtanding thoſe Clouds of ſorrow that hung upon her countenance, becauſe her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band was juſt going to put her away. The King therefore having engag'd her to entruſt him with the cauſe of her grief, offer'd her his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and promis'd to marry her, having under
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:53606:36"/> pretence of conſanguinity vacated his Marriage with <hi>Bertha,</hi> the Daughter of the Count of <hi>Friſe,</hi> whom he had baniſh'd to <hi>Montrevil</hi> upon the Sea. <hi>Bertrade</hi> ſuffer'd her ſelf to be ſurpriz'd with theſe alluring hopes, and conſented to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh'd away by force. The King thus ſatisfy'd, after he and <hi>Bertrade</hi> had conſulted upon the ways and means which way to effect their deſigne, departed for <hi>Orleans,</hi> and left behind him at <hi>Tours</hi> a Gentleman, whoſe name was <hi>William Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin,</hi> to put the project in execution. <hi>Bertrade</hi> and the Knight having conſerted together how to manage the buſineſs, ſhe her ſelf went to hear Maſs at St. <hi>Martin's,</hi> upon <hi>Eaſter-eve,</hi> and after ſhe had ſent away the perſons that attended her upon ſeveral errands, ſlipt into a by Street where <hi>Rechin</hi> waited for her with two Horſes. She made choice of that which went moſt eaſily, and being got a little way out of the City, they met with laid Horſes freſh and freſh every ſix Leagues, and made ſuch haſt, that before Night they reach'd <hi>Orleans,</hi> where the King, who had notice of every thing, receiv'd 'em with thoſe tranſports of joy that are hardly to be expreſs'd.

The King, who as yet had not eſpy'd that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in her, lov'd her ſo tenderly, that he could not find in his Heart to leave her in <hi>France,</hi> when he undertook his expedition to the Holy-land, but engag'd her to be the companion of all his dangers. They embarqu'd together at <hi>Aigues-Mortes,</hi> and after ſeveral hardſhips, arriv'd at length at <hi>Antioſſia,</hi> where <hi>Hugo Raymund,</hi> the Queen's Uncle, and Brother to Duke <hi>William,</hi> had obtain'd the Principality. He gave the King a moſt magnificent reception; and left nothing omitted to oblige him to make a ſtop there. He laid before him, the <hi>Noradin</hi> the Soldan of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> made frequent incurſions to the very gates of the City; and that 'twas greatly to be fear'd, that that ſame place, of ſo great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance would fall into the hands of the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, if he were not powerfully aſſiſted by His Majeſty.

However all his, artifices prov'd fruitleſs; he could not detain the King but very few days at <hi>Antioch. Lewis</hi> therefore, impatient to be at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> purſu'd his journey, notwithſtanding all the reaſons that could be alledg'd to him; neither was <hi>Eleonor</hi> ſo ſorry as <hi>Raymund.</hi> For ſhe was altogether for preſent objects, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got the Prince of <hi>Antiochia,</hi> ſo ſoon as ſhe had loſt ſight of him. She had ſeveral others that would not permit her to ſhed tears for his abſence; and as ſhe never repuls'd any one that ſigh'd for Love of her, her Court was always well fill'd: but tho' in the Court of a Queen, yet becauſe it was in a Camp among none but Soldiers, the diſcourſe was generally Military; and the warlike atchievments of every day, produc'd ſufficient matter for every days entertainment. Nor, did they forget their Enemies the Turks, whom were ſignal either for their Birth or Valor, ſo that 'twas impoſſible to paſs in ſilence the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:53606:38"/> qualities of <hi>Saladin,</hi> the Soldan of <hi>Damaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi>'s Nephew. 'Twas ſaid of him, that he was a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> perſon well ſhap'd, nimble in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of exerciſes, Valiant, Generous, Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, Courtly; and in a word, that he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du'd withal the French manners. There were alſo ſome who added, that he was deſcended from the Count of <hi>Ponthieu,</hi> whoſe Daughter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken at Sea, was preſented to the Soldan of <hi>Aleppo</hi> the Brother of <hi>Moradin,</hi> who receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her into the number of his Wives, had this Prince by her. Now, thô' this ſtory were a meer fable, yet it fail'd not to augment the curioſity which the Queen had for <hi>Saladin:</hi> ſhe ſought for opportunities; and for a beginning, to enter into a correſpondence with him, ſhe wrote to him in the behalf of <hi>Sandebrevil,</hi> Lord of <hi>Sauzay,</hi> who had been taken ſome days before by a party which that Mahometan Prince commanded. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladin</hi> granted the Queen whatever ſhe deſir'd, and ſent her back the Priſoner without Ranſome, <hi>Eleonor</hi> had ſeveral conferences with <hi>Sandebre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> on purpoſe to inform her ſelf of ſeveral circumſtances which ſhe deſir'd to know, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the perſon of <hi>Saladin:</hi> She alſo made uſe of him to procure an interview between <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladin</hi> and her. To that purpoſe ſhe appointed a Hunting match, about two Leagues from <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> where <hi>Saladin</hi> met her with thirty Horſe-Men only. So ſoon as he ſaw the Queen appear, he left his Troop that had made a halt, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing an eaſie hand Gallop toward her, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently alighted to ſalute her: he made her a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:53606:39"/> in the Italian Tongue, which the Queen underſtood very well, and after ſuch a manner, as nothing ſavour'd of the barbarity of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; nor was ſhe leſs taken with his Wit, then with his deportment: She oblig'd him to mount his Courſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo they rode ſoftly together into a Wood of Palm-trees cloſe adjoyning, where they were a long time in diſcourſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Eleonor</hi> return'd him thanks in a moſt obliging manner, for what he had done for <hi>Sande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brevil</hi> at her requeſt, and pulling off an embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd Scarf that ſerv'd her inſtead of a girdle, preſented it to him, deſiring him to keep it as a teſtimony of her eſteem and acknowledgment; which <hi>Saladin</hi> afterwards wore upon all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of danger. But ſhe was diſcover'd by ſome Courtiers, who gave an accompt of the whole ſtory to the King, and others aſſur'd him that the Queen had given <hi>Saladin</hi> ſeveral other meetings. Now tho' there were more of vanity on both ſides in this ſame courtly correſpondence, the King was extreamly troubl'd at it, and would ſtay no longer at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> So that after he had taken his leave of King <hi>Baldwin,</hi> he ſet Sail withal his Fleet; but was oblig'd to put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Sicily</hi> to refit his Ships, which had been but ill handled by <hi>Manuel</hi> the Emperor of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi>'s Navy. 'Tis very probable, that the Queen had made her peace in that Iſland; for ſhe grew bigg with Child, and lay in, upon her return into <hi>France,</hi> of a Daughter nam'd <hi>Alice,</hi> who was marry'd afterwards to <hi>Thibaut</hi> Count of <hi>Blois.</hi> But ſome time after ſhe was brought
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:53606:39"/> to Bed, the King being inform'd of all <hi>Eleonor</hi>'s Galantries, reſolv'd to vacate his Marriage. To which purpoſe he aſſembl'd the Clergy of <hi>France</hi> at <hi>Boisgency,</hi> where <hi>Alegrin</hi> his Chancellor ſet forth the reaſons that mov'd the King to deſire a ſeparation, and eaſily obtain'd what his Maſter deſir'd, becauſe the Queen made no oppoſition. However <hi>Lewis,</hi> that he might come off with Honour, ſurrendred back to her the Dutchy of <hi>Aquitaine,</hi> and the Earldom of <hi>Peitou,</hi> which ſhe brought him in Dowry, and only kept the two Daughters which He had by her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eleonor,</hi> after this Divorce, retir'd to <hi>Poitiers,</hi> where ſhe was viſited by <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi> the King of <hi>England</hi>'s Son. Who thô he were a Prince, whoſe Perſon was no way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting, and had the worſt colour'd Hair in the world, yet ſhe fail'd not to admit of his ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and to hearken to the propoſals of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage which he made her, becauſe he was Heir preſumptive to the Crown of <hi>England. Henry</hi> was well inform'd of all the diſorders of her paſt life; but his eager deſire to joyn <hi>Guyenne</hi> and <hi>Peitou,</hi> to the reſt of thoſe Dominions, which he was to inherit, prevail'd over all other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations. He eſpous'd <hi>Eleonor;</hi> which ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd <hi>Lewis,</hi> that he ſuffer'd no opportunity of Revenge to eſcape him. So that a War was kindl'd between the two Princes, ſo ſoon as <hi>Henry</hi> came to the Crown, which laſted till an end was put to it by the Marriage of <hi>Henry</hi> the King of <hi>England</hi>'s eldeſt Son, with <hi>Margaret,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Lewis,</hi> and <hi>Eliſabeth</hi> of <hi>Caſtille,</hi> his
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:53606:40"/> ſecond Wife. And thô the affianc'd Princeſs were but five years of Age, ſhe was put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of the King of <hi>England,</hi> for a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirmation of the Alliance. When ſhe came to be of age, proper for the conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Nuptials, the King of <hi>England</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd to deliver her to his Son, for fear he ſhould become too potent, and go about to dethrone him, with the aſſiſtance of <hi>France.</hi> Thereupon <hi>Henry,</hi> impatient to enjoy his youthful Spouſe, that was to ſecure him his Succeſſion to the Crown of <hi>England</hi> (the Princeſs being deſign'd to the Heir of the Kingdom) he ſtole her away, and fled into <hi>France</hi> to the King his Father-in law. From thence he wrote to his own Father, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding <hi>England,</hi> or the Dutchy of <hi>Normandy,</hi> as an Earneſt of his Succeſſion: and upon the King's refuſal, reſolv'd to obtain his Pretenſions by force of Arms. Queen <hi>Eleonor</hi> alſo engag'd <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>Aquitain,</hi> and <hi>Jeoffrey</hi> Duke of <hi>Bretagne,</hi> her Brothers, to take part with <hi>Henry:</hi> and <hi>Lewis</hi> oblig'd <hi>William,</hi> King of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to invade <hi>England</hi> on that ſide, while he ſent <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> with a powerful Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, to make a deſcent into the Iſland out of <hi>France.</hi> So that a Man would have thought that the King of <hi>England,</hi> aſſail'd on every ſide, muſt have been overwhelmed by ſo many Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. But Heaven protected him. His Son <hi>Henry</hi> dy'd in a ſhort time after, and Peace was concluded between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France:</hi> and the Marriage of <hi>Richard,</hi> who was become Heir to the Crown by the death of <hi>Henry,</hi> with <hi>Alice</hi>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:53606:40"/> the Daughter of <hi>Lewis,</hi> was the Seal of that Union. But in regard the Princeſs was very young, ſhe was put into the hands of the King of <hi>England,</hi> as her Siſter had been, till ſhe came to years of maturity; and Queen <hi>Eleonor</hi> was ſhut up in cloſe impriſonment, to prevent her contriving new troubles at Court. In the mean time King <hi>Henry</hi> ſhew'd himſelf ſo extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly complaiſant to the Princeſs <hi>Alice,</hi> that it was look'd upon to be an effect of love; and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs anſwer'd him with a frankneſs, pardonable as her years: however, <hi>Richard</hi> grew jealous to that degree, that he could not find in his heart to marry her, when he came to the Crown. Queen <hi>Eleonor</hi> alſo, whom he ſet at liberty ſo ſoon as he ſaw himſelf ſeated upon the Throne, confirm'd him in his averſion, and negotiated a Match between him and <hi>Beranguelle,</hi> the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Don <hi>Garcias,</hi> King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> whom ſhe carry'd to <hi>Richard</hi> then in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> where he eſpous'd her. This anger'd <hi>Philip,</hi> ſurnam'd the <hi>Auguſt,</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> who at the ſame time had made a voyage to the Holy Land; but he would not ſhew his reſentment there, for the injury done his Siſter, becauſe he would not give the Infidels an opportunity to take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the diviſion of the Chriſtians. But ſo ſoon as he return'd into <hi>France,</hi> he enter'd the Territories of the King of <hi>England</hi> in revenge. At length <hi>Eleonor,</hi> after ſhe had been the cauſe of many miſchiefs in both Kingdoms, where ſhe had worn the Crown, ended her days at <hi>Poitiers,</hi> in the Fourſcore and fourth year of her age.</p>

However, he endeavour'd a long time to combat this averſion; but not being able to ſurmount it, he imparted the ſecret of his diſguſt to <hi>William,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Beauvais,</hi> who told him, that in regard there was a near affinity between him and the Queen, it would be no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult thing for him to diſannul the Marriage, if he would ſummon an Aſſembly of the Prelats of his Kingdom. The King reliſh'd this Propoſal, and having ſent for all the Biſhops of <hi>France,</hi> and amongſt the reſt, for the Archbiſhop of <hi>Rheims,</hi> who preſided in the Aſſembly, the ſentence of Separation was pronounc'd. Some time before the King had ſeen the Portraicture of <hi>Mary Agnes,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Bertol</hi> Duke of <hi>Moravis,</hi> which appear'd ſo charming to him, that he had always the <hi>Idea</hi> of her in his ſight. Therefore, when he ſaw himſelf at liberty, he ſent to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand her in Marriage, and having obtain'd his deſires, he eſpous'd her with a more then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Magnificence.</p>

                     <hi>Iſemburg</hi> would not be preſent at the Nuptial Ceremony, but ſecretly left the Court, with a deſign to retire into <hi>Denmark.</hi> But when ſhe came to the Frontiers of <hi>France,</hi> ſhe bethought her ſelf of the fault ſhe was about to commit, in abandoning the Juſtice of her Cauſe: ſhe return'd back again, and ſhutting her ſelf up in a Convent, ſent an account of her miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune to King <hi>Conuie,</hi> her Brother. He, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſtoniſh'd at <hi>Philip</hi>'s inconſtancy, ſent to his Ambaſſador then reſiding in <hi>Rome,</hi> to make his complaints to Pope <hi>Celeſtin,</hi> and to demand Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of him. <hi>Celeſtin</hi> immediately diſpatch'd away two Cardinals, the one a Prieſt, and the other a Deacon, to make inquiry into what had paſt, in the diſſolution of the Marriage, and to make uſe of all the Authority of the Holy See, to oblige the King to take <hi>Iſemburg</hi> again, in caſe he had no lawful cauſe of ſeparation. So ſoon as the two Legates arriv'd at <hi>Paris,</hi> they call'd together an Aſſembly of the Clergy, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Motives to the annulling the King's Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with the Princeſs of <hi>Denmark,</hi> were ſtrictly examin'd. But, tho' the Prelates aſſembl'd ſaw well, that the ſentence of Separation that had been pronounc'd, was ſlight enough, yet they durſt not attempt to revoke it, for fear of the King's Indignation. However, Pope <hi>Celeſtin</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead, <hi>Innocent</hi> III. his ſucceſſor, at the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitation of the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Ambaſſador, ſent into <hi>France</hi> the Cardinal <hi>Sta Sabina,</hi> with order to make uſe of all the moſt effectual means to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige the King to a reconciliation with <hi>Iſemburg.</hi>
                     <pb n="78" facs="tcp:53606:42"/> When the Legate arriv'd, he aſſembl'd a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil at <hi>Lyon,</hi> and cited the King,, together with all thoſe that had pronounc'd the ſentence of Separation, to make their appearance, but <hi>Philip,</hi> inſtead of appearing, ſent a Herald, to Proteſt the Nullitie of whatever ſhould be done to his prejudice, and to appeal as from an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper Judge to the Pope, or the next Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council. But for all that, the Legate went on, and by advice of the Prelats aſſembl'd, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated the King, and Interdicted the whole Kingdom. <hi>Philip</hi> enrag'd at theſe vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Proceedings, caus'd the ſentence of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly to be declar'd void, by a Decree of his Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> upon the motion of the Advocate-General: and to puniſh the Biſhops who had been ſo daring, as to deal ſo unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily by him, he ſeiz'd upon their Temporal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. In the mean time, well underſtanding, that <hi>Iſemburg</hi> had been the occaſion of all theſe troubles, he ſent her to the Caſtle of <hi>Eſtampes,</hi> with a prohibition not to ſtir from thence, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pain of being declar'd Guilty of High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Moravia,</hi> who was a Woman of great virtue, and very nice in her ſentiments, was afraid that all <hi>Europe</hi> would look upon her, as the cauſe of the Divorce, in regard the King had ſo often given her in publick, ſuch tranſcendent marks of his affection. She was deſirous there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be gratefull, and willingly would have reſign'd her own Life, to have appeas'd theſe troubles, provided that the King her Husband's
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:53606:42"/> honour, might not be wounded by the accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. She beſought him therefore ſeveral times, that he would permit her to retire into a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent. But his paſſion for her was too violent to conſent to ſuch a ſeparation, and he was too haughty to give his Enemies an occaſion to think, that he ſubmitted out of any ſentiments of fear. But as it impoſſible for Princes long to conceal the moſt ſecret emotions of their Souls, the favourers of <hi>Iſemburg</hi> had found out, that the violent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of the Legat had not a little contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to exaſperate <hi>Philip</hi> againſt any reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with that unfortunate Princeſs. Preſently therefore they acquainted the Pope with the King's inclinations, who yielding to their reaſons, ſent into <hi>France</hi> two new Legats, <hi>Octavian</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Oſtia,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Velitri,</hi> with Orders to make uſe of gentler means. Thoſe two Legats, after they had aſſembl'd another Council at <hi>Soiſſons,</hi> immediately took off the excommunication that had been thunder'd out againſt <hi>Philip. Mary</hi> likewiſe laid hold upon this opportunity, to beſeech His Majeſty to take <hi>Iſembergh</hi> again, and ſhe aſſail'd him with argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſo pathetically moving and ſo judicious, that at length he conſented. Thereupon he ſent for <hi>Iſemburgh</hi> to his Palace; but the more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous <hi>Mary</hi> had appear'd to him, the more it griev'd him to have ſeparated from her. So that after he had remain'd about forty days with <hi>Iſemburg</hi> he ſent her to a Monaſtery. The two Legats having notice of this ſo ſudden and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected change, ſummon'd a new aſſembly to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:53606:43"/> meet at <hi>Soiſſons. Mary</hi> therefore afraid of the freſh troubles into which the King was about to precipitate himſelf, would return to him no more, and preſs'd him ſo earneſtly, that ſhe might have leave to retire, that at laſt with his conſent, ſhe betook her ſelf to the Abby of <hi>Boiſſy.</hi> But it was not without an extream violence upon her ſelf, that ſhe took this reſolution. She lov'd <hi>Philip</hi> ſincerely, and it was meerly to procure him that repoſe, of which he was going to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive himſelf for her ſake, that ſhe could prevail upon her ſelf to looſe him for ever. And the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat ſhe had in her mind, before ſhe could obtain this victory over her ſelf, reduc'd her to ſuch a low condition of Health, that at length ſhe ſunk under the weight of her affliction, and dy'd within a Month after her retirement from Court. Juſt before her death, ſhe wrote to <hi>Philip,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching him to take <hi>Iſemburg</hi> again, and to live lovingly with her. The King, not able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe her this complacency, at a time when ſhe gave him ſuch tranſcending marks of her Love, took Horſe, and rode alone to the Convent, where <hi>Iſemburg</hi> lay. He ſent for her out of the Abby, and taking her up behind him, carry'd her back to his Palace, where he liv'd with her, after that, in perfect Conjugal ſociety: nor did ſhe die, till many years after, in the Reign of <hi>St. Lewis.</hi> The Pope was alſo ſo glad of this reconciliation, that to comfort <hi>Philip</hi> for the loſs of <hi>Mary,</hi> he legitimated the two Children he had by her.</p>

                     <hi>PHILIP</hi> the <hi>Fair</hi> had Three Sons who reign'd ſucceſſively after him; <hi>Lewis,</hi> whom he made King of <hi>Navarre</hi> in his life time, and who marry'd <hi>Margaret</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Robert</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy; Philip</hi> Count of <hi>Poitou,</hi> who marry'd <hi>Joan</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Otheliu,</hi> Count of <hi>Burgundy;</hi> and <hi>Charles de la marche,</hi> who mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd <hi>Blanche,</hi> the Daughter of the ſame Count. Theſe three Princeſſes were endow'd with all the Graces, both of Body and Mind; and being of a gay Humor, their Courts were always full. They drew to 'em all the young Perſons of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Rank and Quality, and their uſual divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was Hunting, whither they went ſometimes with the Princes their Husbands, but generally alone with the Officers of their Houſhold, and ſuch Ladies as were wont to be the companions of their Paſtimes: more eſpecially <hi>Philip,</hi> and <hi>Walter de Launoy,</hi> of whom the one was Squire to the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> the other to the Count <hi>de la March,</hi> never left 'em upon theſe occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. They might well be lookt upon for two of the moſt compleat and handſomeſt Lords in the Court, and they were perſons of that brisk and lively Wit, that 'twas impoſſible to be tir'd with their Converſation. The two Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:53606:44"/> 
                     <hi>Margaret</hi> and <hi>Blanche,</hi> ſo well lik'd their jolly Humours, that without ſtopping at Eſteem, they proceeded even to Love. The two Lords, who had great experience in that Paſſion, and had met with very few hard-hearted Ladies, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily perceiv'd the progreſs they had made in the Hearts of thoſe two Ladies: and the Conqueſt was ſo illuſtrious, that without reflecting upon the fatal conſequences of Intreagues of that Nature, they thought of nothing ſo much, as to purſue and preſerve it. They dextrouſly wrought upon the Princes to declare their Minds; and having drawn from their own Lips the important Secret, they engag'd 'em to facilitate the means to make 'em happy. Nor was it a difficult thing to gain the Uſher of the Chamber, and the Princeſſes La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Honour, who introduc'd 'em into their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes Chambers, at a time when all the world was withdrawn to Reſt. Every thing favour'd their deſires. Their Miſtreſſes were the firſt movers, and 'tis eaſie to gueſs, how eaſie it was to proſper in Rendevouzes of that nature. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the Princeſſes afraid of being at laſt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd by their Husbands, begg'd leave of 'em to ſpend the Summer ſeaſon at <hi>Maubuiſon,</hi> near <hi>Pontoiſe,</hi> where they admitted none but perſons that were privy to the Intreague, and abandon'd themſelves wholly to the pleaſure of Loving, and being Belov'd. The two Lovers every night got over the walls of the Garden, and ſlipt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Chambers of Delight, without being ſeen of any body. 'Tis true, the Princeſſes had not imparted any thing of their Love to their Maids
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:53606:44"/> of Honour, in regard, that being young, they miſtruſted their diſcretion. Nevertheleſs, the ſecret, which it ſo much concern'd 'em to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal, was at length diſcover'd by her that was able to make the moſt miſchievous uſe of it. Mademoiſelle <hi>de Morfontaine,</hi> Maid of Honour to the Queen of <hi>Navarr,</hi> had been a long time intreagu'd with <hi>Philip de Launoy,</hi> who had alſo promis'd her Marriage; but being aſſur'd of her Miſtreſs, he began to neglect her. <hi>Morfontaine</hi> perceiving his coldneſs, and imagining he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come inamour'd of ſome, of her companions, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to watch him more narrowly, to the end ſhe might find out her Rivalleſs. There was belonging to the Apartment of the Maids of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, a pair of Back-ſtairs that led into the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. One Evening therefore ſhe ſlipt down thoſe Back ſtairs, and walk'd the Rounds, to ſee whether or no her perfidious <hi>AEneas</hi> did not go to viſit ſome of her companions in the night time. Nor had ſhe long ſtood Centinel, before ſhe perceiv'd ſomebody jump over the Wall. She accoaſted him ſoftly, and thô the Moon did not ſhine, ſhe knew, or elſe ſhe fancy'd ſhe knew him to be <hi>Launoy,</hi> whom ſhe follow'd, without any noiſe to the Queen of <hi>Navarr</hi>'s Apartment. Upon the ſight of this, ſhe ſtood as motionleſs as a Statue, and was ſstill more embarraſs'd then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, not being able to perſuade her ſelf, that he durſt make his Addreſſes to a Perſon ſo far ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour to him. She ſaw the Maid of Honour open the door to him; and when he was enter'd, ſhe liſten'd, to try whether ſhe could diſcover
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:53606:45"/> what he was gone to do in that Apartment. 'Tis eaſie to gueſs at her ſurprize, when ſhe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the Queen of <hi>Navarr</hi>'s expreſſions, that 'twas ſhe her ſelf whom <hi>Launoy</hi> ſought for, and that he was belov'd. Preſently her jealouſie chang'd into fury, and infus'd into her nothing but deſire of Revenge. But after the firſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of her Rage were over, when ſhe ſought, in cool blood, the ways to ſatisfie it, ſhe found 'em encompaſs'd with a thouſand dangers. 'Twas as much as her life was worth, to accuſe her Miſtriſs, without convincing Proofs; and it was to be fear'd, that in taking meaſures to prove the Intreague, ſhe might give her Miſtriſs an occaſion to ſuſpect her deſign, and expoſe her to the dire effects of her anger. She floated ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral days in this uncertainty, but finding her ſelf at length with Child, ſhe thought it her duty to ſacrifice every thing to the revenge of her injur'd Honour. She had a Kinſwoman, a Nun, at <hi>Maubuiſſon,</hi> whom ſhe entruſted with the deplorable Eſtate to which ſhe was reduc'd, and ſo well aggravated the honor of the crime, which the two Lovers committed, in propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the place that enclos'd the Spouſes of Jeſus Chriſt, that ſhe engag'd the Nun to aſſiſt her in ſurprizing the impious Couple together. And they took their meaſures ſo truly, that the two <hi>Launoy</hi>'s were ſurpriz'd in Bed with the two Princeſſes, and were ſtopt in the Convent till the King was inform'd of it. They were both ſent to priſon, and upon their impeachment in Parliament, their crime being ſufficiently prov'd,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:53606:45"/> they were both condemn'd to be Flea'd alive, to have their guilty Members cut off, to be ty'd to the Tails of two wild Horſes, and in that condition to be dragg'd through a new mow'd Meadow. The two Princeſſes were ſhut up in Caſtle <hi>Gaillard,</hi> where the King of <hi>Navarr</hi> caus'd his Wife, in a ſhort time after, to be ſtrangl'd with a Sheet. The Counteſs of <hi>March</hi> obtain'd her liberty, after the Prince her Husband had diſſolv'd the Marriage, under pretence that he was the Godſon of <hi>Mand</hi> of <hi>Artois,</hi> the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of that Princeſs. The Uſher of the Queen of <hi>Navarr</hi>'s Chamber, who was privy to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treague, was hang'd. The Counteſs of <hi>Poitou</hi> was alſo apprehended, but in regard, there was nothing material prov'd againſt her, the Prince her Husband went himſelf to fetch her out of priſon, and by 3 thouſand Careſſes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to make her amends for the Affront ſhe had receiv'd. As for <hi>Morfontaine,</hi> after ſhe had thus fully ſatisfy'd her Revenge, ſhe was tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with moſt cruel remorſes of Conſcience, that ne'er would ſuffer her to reſt, either day or night. Every Minute ſhe thought ſhe ſaw be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her Eyes her Lover in the ſame deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condition, wherein he lay, under the tortures of the Hangman; and after ſhe had languiſh'd in miſery for above a year, ſhe ended her days, deteſting, with a ſincere repentance, the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of her paſt Life.</p>

The King would make one of the number, and danc'd an entry of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages with five Lords of the Court, who were ty'd together with Ropes of Silk. The King as he was dancing, accoaſted the Ducheſs of <hi>Berry,</hi> whom he careſs'd with ſomewhat a more then ordinary freedom, at what time his Brother en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the room, and being over curious to know who that perſon was, in Maſquerade, ſo fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar with the Counteſs, drew near with his Flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beau, and ſet Fire to the Habit of one of the Savages. The flame immediately ran from one to the other, ſo that in an inſtant, they were all in a blaze. <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Poitiers,</hi> Count of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinois,</hi> and <hi>Hongrinant de Janſay,</hi> di'd upon the ſpot. The Count of <hi>Nantouillet</hi> ran to the Cupboard, and throwing himſelf into a Charger full of Water, quench'd the Fire that ſurrounded him. The Count <hi>Jony,</hi> and <hi>Yves de Foix</hi> di'd after they had lain for two days together in a
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:53606:46"/> languiſhing condition: But the Ducheſs of <hi>Berry,</hi> knowing the King, threw the skirt of her Gown over him, and ſav'd him by that means. Dureing the confuſion which this accident had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd in the aſſembly, the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> found himſelf near a Lady who was ready to be ſtifl'd in the croud: he took care of her, and put her into the hands of one of his Gentlemen, who threw Water in her Face, and after he had fetch'd her again from the ſwoon into which ſhe was fallen, carry'd her home to his own houſe. Some few days after, the Duke calling the Lady to mind, ask'd his Gentleman what was become of her, and underſtood that ſhe was the Wife of <hi>Raoulet d'Auteville,</hi> who had been Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of <hi>France,</hi> upon the recommendation of <hi>Philip</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy.</hi> With that he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd that he had been the occaſion of diſplacing him from his employment, for ſeveral miſdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanors, and believ'd, that the little ſervice he had done his Wife would not countervail to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh that averſion, which without queſtion, ſhe had for him. Nevertheleſs in theſe contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties it is, that Love takes delight to ſhew his capricious humours, as the Duke ſoon after found by experience. For one day that he was at Maſs in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Church, he there obſerv'd the fame Lady, who as ſhe paſs'd by, ſaluted him with an obliging ſmile. The Duke was too much a Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier to be ignorant what that meant; and he was too great a Lover of adventures, to fall of the opportunity of making the beſt of 'em. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he ſent a Page to delite Madam <hi>d'Auteville</hi>
                     <pb n="88" facs="tcp:53606:47"/> to meet him in the Evening in the Garden of the Palais <hi>des Touruelles,</hi> where he ſhould be glad to ſpeak with her, and the Lady accepting the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation, fail'd not to meet him at the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. And then it was, that in her melting Breaſt, the Duke ſoon met with ſentiments far oppoſite to thoſe of that ſame hatred, with which he thought her prepoſſeſs'd againſt him, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd her without much trouble, to come to him to his Palace the next Morning. Nor did ſhe fail of being punctual to her hour, and being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd into the Princes Chamber by a back pair of ſtairs, ſhe gave him no cauſe to complain of her cruelty. This viſit was attended by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others, by means of which, the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> underſtood, that ſhe was very intimate with the Ducheſs of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and that ſhe had underſtood by her diſcourſes, that 'twas none of her fault, if he were not belov'd by her. The Duke open'd his Ears to this Propoſal: For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that the Princeſs had charms ſufficient to inflame his amorous deſires, ſhe might prove ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to him in the rearing of his Fortune, by drawing from her Lips the ſecrets of the Duke her Husband, who was declar'd Regent of the Kingdom during the King's diſtemper, and with whom he thought he had a right to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the Government of the Realm. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore left Madam <hi>de Auteville</hi> to manage the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treague, who carry'd it on with ſo much addreſs, that in a ſhort time ſhe accompliſh'd his deſires.</p>

When they had done, they ſet fire to a houſe adjoyning, on purpoſe to amuſe the People, and made their eſcapes through by Lanes and Alleys. The Duke was carry'd into the Marſhal <hi>de Fires</hi> houſe, where he expir'd; and thence to the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictin's Convent. The Parliament took cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſance of this Murder, and order'd a Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor to take the Informations.

He was a Prince both old and gouty, who avoided the World, and ſought retirement only. <hi>Jaqueline,</hi> was quite of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther humour, and could not find in her heart to ſhut her ſelf up in the Country with her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. However ſhe was bound to obedience,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:53606:49"/> and was conſtrain'd to conſine her ſelf with him in a Caſtle, whither he had withdrawn himſelf from the hurry of buſineſs. Nor had ſhe any other conſolation, then to bemoan in private with her Women, the fantaſtick humour of her Husband. Her Maid of honour had formerly made a voyage into <hi>England,</hi> attending at that time upon <hi>Katherine</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> who had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd <hi>Henry</hi> V. and ſhe was return'd with all the Officers of the Houſhold of that Princeſs, whom the King her Husband had ſent back, ſome Months after. Now tho' that Lady had made but a ſhort ſtay in London, nevertheleſs ſhe had ſeen all the magnificence of that Court, of which ſhe made ſo pleaſing a deſcription to her Miſtreſs, that ſhe infus'd into her a deſire to croſs the Sea's, and taſte her ſhare of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures which that Court afforded. The Lady alſo ſpoke to her ſo advantagiouſly of <hi>Humphrey</hi> Duke of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> the King's Brother, that ſhe caus'd her to conceive an eſteem for that Prince, which did not a little diſquiet her repoſe. She deſir'd alſo to ſee his Picture, and open'd her mind to her Maid of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, who found a way to ſatisfy her curioſity. And the Portraicture, and the Perſuaſions of her Woman, increas'd her Chimerical Paſſion to that degree, that ſhe reſolv'd to croſs over into <hi>England.</hi> She imparted her deſign to none but ſuch Officers, whom ſhe could not avoid entruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with her Secret, and having made choice of a day for her departure, ſhe got a Horſe-back with a ſmall Train, carrying all her Jewels along
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:53606:50"/> with her. She got to <hi>Dunkirke,</hi> whence ſhe embark'd for <hi>Dover,</hi> and ſo for <hi>London.</hi> She was well receiv'd by the King of <hi>England,</hi> and better by the Duke of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> who had been inform'd how much he was concern'd in the voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age which ſhe had undertaken. And he knew ſo well how to make the beſt of her preventing him, that he oblig'd her to yield her fell up to him, upon the faith of a Marriage, which ſhe could not contract, in regard ſhe had a Husband living. But the King of <hi>England</hi>'s complacency in indulging her idle Paſſion, had like to have broken the good correſpondence between him and the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> Couſin to the Duke of <hi>Brabant</hi> his kinſman; but reaſon af State pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd above that frivilous Diſguſt. Sometime after, <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> Duke of <hi>Luxembourg,</hi> Governor of the Counties of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> ordain'd his Heir <hi>Philip</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> his Siſters Son, without making any mention in his Will of <hi>Jaqueline,</hi> his Neece by the Father's ſide; which oblig'd her to return into <hi>Haynault,</hi> where the Duke of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> would needs, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany her. She was receiv'd by her Subjects with extraordinary Magnificence, notwithſtanding the oppoſition of the Counts of <hi>Converſano</hi> and <hi>Anguien,</hi> who ſided with the Duke of <hi>Brabant.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> alſo endeavour'd to make himſelf Maſter of ſuch places as he pretended were fall'n to <hi>Jaqueline,</hi> by the death of the Duke of <hi>Luxembourg.</hi> But he was conſtrain'd to quit his enterprize, and her whole Rights he maintain'd, becauſe Pope <hi>Martin</hi> V. threaten'd
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:53606:50"/> him with Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures if he did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the Duke of <hi>Brabant</hi> his diſloyal Wife. The Duke obey'd without any reluctance, and was glad of that pretence to abandon <hi>Jaqueline,</hi> that ſhe might not perceive he was become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful, and paid his Vows to another Shrine. For <hi>Jaqueline</hi> had taken along with her into <hi>Hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nault</hi> an Engliſh Lady, who was call'd Madam <hi>Shelton;</hi> and the Duke was ſoon aware of the advantage which that Lady had over her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, as well for the Graces of her Body, as for the fineneſs of her Wit, and delicacy of her Sentiments. Nor could he withſtand ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny charms, and finding they concurr'd with his Sedulities, he was glad to find himſelf at liberty, that he might follow his own inclinations. He therefore left the Dutcheſs at <hi>Mons,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd into <hi>England,</hi> where he marry'd Madam <hi>Shelton.</hi> But the Duke of <hi>Glouceſter</hi>'s infidelity was not the only thing which troubl'd the Dutcheſs; ſhe fear'd the effects of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's juſt reſentment; and ſhe imagin'd every moment, that ſhe ſaw him invading her Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories with an armed Force. But the death of the Duke deliver'd her from theſe Fears<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> news being brought her in the midſt of her diſturban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances, that a Feaver which ſeaz'd him at <hi>Bruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,</hi> had put an end both to his Life and his Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies.</p>

To which purpoſe ſhe addreſs'd her ſelf to <hi>Charles</hi> VII. at <hi>Vienne,</hi> in the <hi>Dauphinate,</hi> beſeeching him to make uſe of his Authority, with the Duke, to oblige him to gratifie her Requeſt. The King, who was naturally prone to Acts of kindneſs, comply'd with the Dutcheſs, and was deſirous to ſerve her: but the cruel Wars, which he had at that time with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſo buſily employ'd his time and thoughts, that the Dutcheſs would have receiv'd but little ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from him, had not another motive more preſſing then that of Generoſity, ſpurr'd him forward. The Dutcheſs had brought along with her <hi>Agnes Forelle,</hi> who was one of her Maids of Honour: and the King being charm'd with her Beauty, engag'd himſelf to ſerve the Duke of <hi>Barr</hi> to the utmoſt of his Power; and in ſhort, he did oblige the Count to ſet him at liberty. <hi>Agnes</hi> acknowledg'd the King's Favour, with all Reſpect that was due to his Perſon, and ſhew'd
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:53606:51"/> him all the complacency that became her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty. And now the Ducheſs having done her buſineſs, prepar'd for her voyage into <hi>Sicily</hi> with the King her Husband; and according to all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearnces, <hi>Agnes</hi> was to have waited upon her. But the King, that he might oblige her to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide at Court, made uſe of <hi>Merlin</hi> the famous <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologer.</hi> One day that <hi>Charles</hi> was alone with <hi>Agnes, Merlin</hi> enter'd the Room; at what time the King, as had been concerted between 'em, ask'd him what he thought of the Fortune of that fair Lady. Sir, reply'd <hi>Merlin,</hi> either there is no Truth in the Stars, or elſe ſhe will be the Miſtreſs of ſome Great King. <hi>Agnes,</hi> who preſently perceiv'd the Artifice, made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer with a ſmile, If it be ſo, Sir, I beſeech, your Majeſty to give me leave to croſs over in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>England,</hi> to the end my deſtiny may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd: there being no likelyhood that the Prediction concerns your Majeſty, who have hardly a Third part of your Kingdom left ye. <hi>Charles</hi> underſtood Raillerie, and joak'd with <hi>Agnes</hi> upon her Repartee: but he made his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of it however. And 'tis ſaid, that his eager deſire to render himſelf worthy the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of that Virgin, exalted his Courage to perform thoſe noble Atchievements afterwards, that made his Reign ſo Illuſtrious. <hi>Agnes,</hi> tho' ſhe had treated him like a King, deſpoil'd of his Dominions, yet could ſhe not chuſe but applaud her ſelf for the conqueſt ſhe had made of his Heart, which ſhe was no leſs covetous of preſerving to her ſelf; and therefore was as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:53606:52"/> as he, to ſecond the means of which he had bethought himſelf to ſtop her journey. She feign'd her ſelf ſick, and the King's Phyſitians that viſited her, confirm'd it, by the King's Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and gave it for their Opinion, that ſhe could not travel without endangering her Life; the Queen alſo promiſing the Ducheſs to take par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular care of her, and to ſend her after her, ſo ſoon as ſhe had recover'd her health. Now, tho' the Dutcheſs well knew, that <hi>Agnes</hi> was not ſo ſick as ſhe made her ſelf, and that ſhe ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the beſt part of the Truth, ſhe took little no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it, believing that if the Queen, who had moſt reaſon to concern her ſelf, were ſo free to give her conſent, 'twas not for her to make any oppoſition. After ſhe was gone, <hi>Agnes</hi> grew better and better every day, and ſoon after quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her bed of Sickneſs. And then ſhe appear'd at Court with new Charms, and the King's Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for her, became ſo ſtrong, that he heap'd upon her new Favours every day. He gave her the County of <hi>Ponthieure,</hi> and finding her to be a Woman of a ſolid Judgment, he conſulted her in Affairs of the greateſt importance, and ſhe was the Conduit-pipe through which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd all his Favours. All the Court look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the King's kindneſs to her with Envy; but more eſpecially the Dauphin, who being already of age ſufficient to have a ſhare in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſtomach'd to ſee that his Father impart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed none of his deſigns to him. Thô <hi>Agnes</hi> let no occaſion of doing him good offices eſcape her, he look'd upon all Kindneſſes, all Favours,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:53606:52"/> which he receiv'd upon her recommendation, as ſo many empoiſon'd Preſents. Therefore he made it his continual ſtudy, by what means he could, to deſtroy her in the King's Affection: amd in regrrd there was no way to do it, but by repreſenting her diſloyal to the King's Bed, he made it his buſineſs to put a Gallant upon her, who, as he was ſufficiently devoted to his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, ſo he had merit enough to kindle the King's jealouſie. To this purpoſe he caſt his eyes upon <hi>Chabane,</hi> the Count of <hi>Dammartin,</hi> who, of all the Perſons at Court, was the moſt accompliſh'd for Beauty and Parts, and broke the propoſal to him. The Count trembl'd at the firſt overture that was made him, and told the Prince, that thô he ow'd him all the ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that lay in his power, he could not reſolve to engage in an affair, which would infallibly draw upon him his ruine; whether the King thought his Paſſion ſincere, or whether he ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that his love for <hi>Agnes</hi> was but counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited, on purpoſe to undoe her. The Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin encourag'd him, and told him, that ſo far from running any hazard, he would rather pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the King's Favour, by ſacrificing his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Paſſion, in giving him an account of all the marks of tenderneſs which he had receiv'd from the Counteſs of <hi>Ponthieure,</hi> and promiſing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to viſit her more. <hi>Chabane,</hi> over-rul'd by the Dauphin's Reaſons, apply'd himſelf wholly to the buſineſs, and made it his ſtudy to bring about his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. He had a <hi>Valet de chamber,</hi> a crafty nimble youngſter, nam'd <hi>St. Colombe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> whom he entruſted
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:53606:53"/> with the falſe ſhew of his Love for the Counteſs, and engag'd him to court <hi>Mortaigne,</hi> who of all her Waiting Women, was the perſon in whom ſhe put the greateſt confidence. <hi>St. Columbe</hi> was eaſily perſwaded to undertake the buſineſs, and in regard he was very handſome, he found little reſiſtance in <hi>Mortaigne</hi>'s tender Heart, who quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gave him all the moſt particular marks of her Affection. When <hi>St. Columbe</hi> had obtain'd his deſires, he inſinuated into his Miſtriſs, that it would be more eaſie for 'em to continue their amorous Commerce, if ſhe could engage the Counteſs in an intreague with <hi>Chabane. Mortaigne</hi> approv'd her Lovers advice; and from that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Evening ſhe labour'd to bring it about. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alone with her Miſtriſs when ſhe was going to Bed, ſhe began to talk of all the Lords of the Court, and after ſhe had given her opinion of every one, ſhe nam'd to her, after a careleſs man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the Count of <hi>Dammartin.</hi> Upon the hearing of that name only, the Ladies countenance chang'd, and ſhe ſhew'd ſuch an averſion for him, that <hi>Mortaigne</hi> durſt nor ſpeak a word more. However, ſhe gave an account to her Lover, who made his report to his Maſter, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing the leaſt circumſtance. <hi>Chabane</hi> revolving in his Mind the Counteſſes behaviour, to ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Counteſs had any reaſon to hate him, and being convinc'd that he had never done any thing to diſpleaſe her, he Divin'd the Truth, and rightly Judg'd, that thoſe marks of averſion were only an effect of the Indignation of that lovely Lady, that he was the only perſon at
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:53606:53"/> Court, who had withſtood the power of her Charms, and that he had never anſwer'd thoſe paſſionate glances, which ſhe had caſt upon him in vain. He examin'd with himſelf, what courſe he ought to take, and thought, it the ſafeſt way to engage the Counteſs to make the firſt ſteps. He gave her to underſtand, that he underſtood the Language of the Eyes; but at the ſame time he avoided all occaſions of ſpeaking to her. But the Counteſs was ſtill more offended, when ſhe perceiv'd that he had div'd into the Sentiments of her Heart, yet never ſtirr'd a foot to make any advantage of her favourable Inclinations. She therefore lookt upon it as a point of Honour to make him ſenſible, and meeting him one day in a dark paſſage, that led from her Apartment to the King's, at what time he paſs'd on with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making any ſtop; Am I ſo terrible, Count, ſaid ſhe, that you ſhould fly me thus? More then you can imagine, Madam, reply'd <hi>Chabane:</hi> a Lady ſo beautiful as your ſelf is enough to make the moſt undaunted courage tremble. Is it then ſo great a miſchief to love me, reply'd the Counteſs? Yes, Madam, reply'd <hi>Chabane,</hi> when a Man can never hope to be happy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out betraying his Maſter. You are very nice for a Courtier, added the Counteſs; but we know how to cure your ſcruples. She ſaid no more, but after ſhe had ſpoken theſe words, paſt on, afraid of being ſurpriz'd in a Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, which the nature of the place would have render'd ſuſpitious. <hi>Chabane</hi> ſtood there for ſome time, ruminating upon this Adventure;
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:53606:54"/> for he would have willingly ſerv'd the Dauphin, but he could not find in his heart, to betray a perſon that had appear'd ſo amiable to him. Nevertheleſs, his Love prevail'd above his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and he reſolv'd to think of nothing but making himſelf happy, and preſerving ſo good a fortune. He ſaw his Affairs in ſo fair a way, that there wanted nothing toward obtaining all that he could deſire, but to be alone with the Counteſs, and to that purpoſe, he addreſs'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to <hi>Mortaigne.</hi> He told her that he found himſelf very unhappy, to have drawn upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the hatred of her Miſtreſs, thô he knew not which way he had deſerv'd ſo great a misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, but that he was reſolv'd to know the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it from her own Lips, or to kill himſelf before her Face; and therefore begg'd of her to give him an opportunity to diſcourſe the Counteſs alone. <hi>Mortaigne</hi> excus'd her ſelf at firſt, and told him, that knowing ſo well as ſhe did, her Miſtreſſes Mind, ſhe muſt expect the utmoſt of her Miſtreſſes indignation, ſhould ſhe contribute to an interview of that nature. But the Count, who knew well enough, that <hi>Agnes</hi> would not be ſo much offended at the ſight of him, as <hi>Mortaign</hi> imagin'd, could have eaſily diſ-abus'd her, durſt he have diſcover'd a ſecret which the Counteſs had conceal'd from her, for fear of being accus'd of indiſcretion. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he made uſe of another Fetch to encourage her, and gave her to underſtand, that ſhe might eaſily do him ſuch a piece of ſervice, without appearing in the leaſt to have contributed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:53606:54"/> it. Theſe reaſons, and a rich Diamond Ring which he put upon <hi>Mortaignes</hi> Finger to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally defeated her. She promis'd to introduce him into a Wardrobe of which ſhe had the key, from whence he might ſlip into the Counteſſes Chamber, ſo ſoon as ſhe had left her. And this expedient proſper'd. <hi>Agnes</hi> was ſurpriz'd to ſee <hi>Chabane,</hi> ſo late in her apartment: but at length, ſeeing 'twas ſo, ſhe thought it became her to make the beſt of the opportunity; and without ſpending time in uſeleſs conteſts, ſhe knew better, then to waſt thoſe minutes that Love makes pretious.</p>
                  <p>This intreague laſted a long time, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcover'd, there being nothing to interrupt it, but the importunities of the Dauphin, who preſs'd <hi>Chabane</hi> to give him an opportunity, to let the King ſee that his Miſtreſs was diſloyal to him. <hi>Chabane</hi> excus'd himſelf, and deny'd his being in a capacity to ſerve him, under ſeveral protences; which tho' they were accompani'd with a great deal of probability, yet the Prince who was not to be baffl'd ſuſpected that <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane</hi> did not deal fairly by him. Therefore to find out the truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he engag'd the Dauphineſs to enter in a ſtrict ſociety with the Counteſs, and to admit her into all her ſports and Matches that ſhe made. On the otherſule, <hi>Chabane,</hi> that he might not be known, was introduc'd into his Miſtreſſes's chamber in Liveries, ſometimes of one colour, ſometimes of another, feigning to carry ſome meſſage. One Evening that he went thither in the Dauphineſſes Livery, the King and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:53606:55"/> the Dauphin enter'd; and in regard there was no light in the chamber, the Count ſtole out again, without being ſeen. However the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs afraid leſt the ſhadow of her Lover might have been perceiv'd, to remove all ſuſpition from the King, told him that the Dauphineſs had ſent her Lacquey to give notice of a match that ſhe had made againſt the next day. But the Young Prince was too cunning to fall into ſuch a ſnare; he rightly judg'd, it was not for nothing that the Counteſs had no light in her Chamber, and made no queſtion but the Lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quey was ſome Lover in diſguiſe. Nevertheleſs for his better ſatiſfaction, ſo ſoon as he return'd to his apartment, he ask'd the Dauphineſs, what meſſage ſhe had ſent to the Counteſs, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood from her own Lips, that ſhe had ſent no body to her, of any errand at all.</p>
                  <p>Now, tho' the Dauphin were convinc'd of the truth, by all theſe circumſtances, theſe were not proofs ſufficient to diſabuſe the King, who was abſolutely convinc'd of the Loyalty of his Miſtreſs: and therefore, there was a neceſſity of ſurprizing her a Bed with <hi>Chabane.</hi> To which purpoſe, he gave order to one of the Scotch Guards, to have a vigilant Eye upon the actions of the two Lovers. The Souldier acquitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with extraordinary exactneſs, and came one Evening to inform the Dauphine, that <hi>Chabane</hi> was gone into the Counteſſes lodging, in the habit of a Lace-Merchant. Immediately the Dauphin poſted to her apartment, but diſcover'd nothing, in regard the Counteſs had hid her Lover upon
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:53606:55"/> the firſt noiſe that ſhe heard. Upon the Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phines viſit, <hi>Chabane</hi> thought he was betray'd, and therefore gave order to <hi>St. Columbre,</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve whither any body watch'd him. Who ſo faithfully diſcharg'd his duty, that they found the Souldier upon the watch at the entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Counteſſes apartment, and preſently gave <hi>Chabane</hi> notice of it; who for that reaſon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore meeting his Miſtreſs that Night, for fear of being ſurpriz'd, and rightly judging, that it would be impoſſible to continue his amorous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, unleſs he could get rid of the ſpy that was ſet to watch him, order'd St. <hi>Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="4 letters">

Thereupon St. <hi>Columbe</hi> riggl'd himſelf into the acquaintance of the Scotch Soldier, and having carry'd him to a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, after they had done drinking, led him through a blind ſtreet, where he had poſted half a dozen deſperate Raskels, that fell upon him, and laid him dead upon the pavement. One of the Duke of <hi>Tremovilles</hi> Lacqueys, who was a kin to the Scotch Soldier, ſeeing him attack'd, went to call ſome of his comrades, and came to his reſcue, but too late; for the buſineſs was done, and the Murderers were diſpers'd. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, in regard that ſeveral perſons in the Duke of <hi>Tremouilles</hi> Livery were ſeen about the body, the Duke himſelf was accus'd to have been the author of the Aſſaſination. The Dauphin was the only perſon that would not be ſurpriz'd by theſe appearances, as gueſſing right, that the Murther was committed by the order of <hi>Chabane.</hi> Nevertheleſs he would not take any notice of it

Therefore he ſaid no more, but ſet other ſpies to work, and caus'd the Counteſs to be ſo narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly watch'd, that word was brought him that <hi>Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Dauphin alſo had order'd all the Avenues to be ſo well guarded, that it was impoſſible for the Count of <hi>Dammartin</hi> to eſcape. But the Counteſs hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing timely notice by <hi>Mortaigne,</hi> who kept diligent watch and ward, lockt him up in a Cloſet by the ſide of the Bed, which the King had never obſerv'd, as being cover'd with the Hangings. So that the King found his Miſtreſs a Bed; and while he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aming the Books that lay by her, the Dauphin askt her between jeſt and earneſt, what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the Bookſeller that ſold her the Books? To whom the Counteſs with a countenance no way concern'd, made anſwer, that he was gone, but that he could not be out of call, if his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs had any thing to ſay to him. The Dauphin took a Flambeau himſelf, and finding nothing, after he had ſought all about, retir'd without
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:53606:56"/> ſaying a word, full of vexation and ſhame, for the ill ſucceſs of his enterprize. The King on the otherſide, made a thouſand excuſes to the Counteſs, and the better to make his peace, would needs lye with her that night. Nor durſt the Counteſs give him the leaſt denyal, tho' ſhe was ſure to ſpend the night in a ſtrange inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture of pleaſure and diſquiet. Nor was <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane</hi> in a better condition; he was ſo near the Bed that he durſt not breath; and which was worſe, he was forc'd to lye patient, while his own Ears told him, that another was enjoying thoſe pleaſures which were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for himſelf. But at length the King roſe and left him at liberty, to make himſelf amends for his paſt ſufferings. The Counteſs who lookt upon the Dauphin as the Author of all her vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, no longer had the patience, to carry fair with him as ſhe had done before. They had frequent quarrels together, and one day ſuch was the heat of paſſion on both ſides, that the Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin gave her a whirret o'the Ear. Of which ſhe made her complaints to the King, but not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that ſatisfaction which ſhe expected, deſpite and vexation threw her into a languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſeaſe, of which ſhe died in ſix weeks after, and was buri'd in the Collegiate Church. She had two Daughters by the King; <hi>Charlote,</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd <hi>Lewis de Brezè,</hi> Seneſchal of <hi>Normandy,</hi> who ſurprizing her in the act of Adultery, ſtabd' her to death; and <hi>Mary</hi> who eſpous'd <hi>Oliver de Coitiny,</hi> Lord of <hi>Rochefort.</hi>

But that Princeſs rather choſe to unite <hi>Caſtille</hi> to <hi>Aragon,</hi> by the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> eldeſt Son of Don <hi>Juan II.</hi> This negotiation therefore proving unſucceſsful, <hi>Lewis XI.</hi> caſt his Eyes upon the Princeſs <hi>Joane,</hi> which <hi>Joane</hi> of <hi>Caſtille</hi> had had by one of her favourites, and which King <hi>Henry</hi> had acknowledg'd for his Daughter, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he was impotent, in hopes to ſet up the rights of that Princeſs againſt <hi>Iſabell.</hi> But the Duke of <hi>Guienne,</hi> to whom the King made the propoſal, would not ſo much as hear of a match that muſt have engag'd him in a bloody War with the King of <hi>Aragon,</hi> and privately ſent to demand <hi>Mary,</hi> the only Daughter and heireſs of <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy.</hi> But the Duke who ſaw that the greateſt Princes in <hi>Europe</hi> ſought his Daughter, would not determin ſo ſuddenly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the choice of a Son in Law, but without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging his promiſe to any one, kept 'em all in ſuſpence. The Duke of <hi>Guyenne</hi> vex'd at this
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:53606:58"/> heſitation of the Duke, took his leave of the King at <hi>Orleans,</hi> to go and drive away his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy in his own Government. At <hi>Amboiſe</hi> he had a ſight of <hi>Magdalen,</hi> who had been the Widow of <hi>Lewis d' Amboiſe,</hi> about ſix months, who had marry'd her for her beauty, but had no Children by her. The Duke was ſo pleas'd with her converſation, that he forgot for ſome time, that he had left the Court to retire to his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and made a propoſal to Madam <hi>d' Amboiſe</hi> to go along with him: but ſhe excus'd her ſelf, alledging the injury it would be to her reputation. The Duke therefore to vanquiſh her ſcruples, confer'd upon her the County of St. <hi>Severe,</hi> and oblig'd her by that ſame generous preſent, to anſwer his paſſion. The pretence then for her going was to take poſſeſſion of certain Lands, which as ſhe gave out, ſhe had purchas'd of the Duke; and this ſerv'd to conceal the Intreague, that was between him and her. They arriv'd together at <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux,</hi> very well ſatisfi'd with each other; and Madam <hi>d' Amboiſe,</hi> who was not ungratefull for the favours ſhe and receiv'd from the Duke, made uſe of all talents that Heaven had beſtow'd upon her, to preſerve his affection. She ſung with art, and had a charming voice, ſhe plaid upon ſeveral inſtruments, and had a delicate vain in Poetry; ſo that the hours they ſpent toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ne'r ſeem'd tedious. But in regard that Love is not always ſatisfi'd with theſe inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent paſtimes, Madam <hi>d' Amboiſe</hi> was deliver'd of a Daughter, that after the death of the Duke
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:53606:58"/> her Father, was Abbeſs of St. <hi>Paroux</hi> in <hi>Perigort.</hi> The Dukes affection for his Miſtreſs alſo daily increas'd, and their happineſs would have been a ſubject worthy of envy, had not ambition in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted their felicities. For the Duke of <hi>Guyenne</hi> held correſpondences all a long at Court, which made the King jealous. He was afraid leaſt his Brother ſhould grow too potent, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuborn'd <hi>Jourdain Fanre,</hi> Abbot of St. <hi>John de Angeli</hi> to poyſon him. That traytor upon whom the Duke of <hi>Guyenne</hi> had heap'd his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, readily undertook to ſacrifice his life for the hopes of a pitiful reward. To which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he preſented a lovely Peach to Madam <hi>d' Amboiſe,</hi> which he had envenom'd: the Lady gave it her Lover, who ſliceing it into a cup of wine, they eat it both together. Madam <hi>d' Amboiſe</hi> di'd the ſame day, but the Duke lay languiſhing for ſome Months. Nevertheleſs, the violence of the poyſon was ſo ſtrong, that it fetch'd off his hair, the nails of his hands, and depriv'd him of the uſe of his limbs. <hi>Jourdain</hi> was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, and the Biſhop of <hi>Angiers</hi> was ioyn'd in Commiſſion with <hi>Lewis d' Amboiſe,</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Biſhop of <hi>Albi,</hi> to proſecute him.

But Heaven would not permit ſo enormous a crime to go unpuniſh'd; for the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain was conſum'd by a flaſh of Lightning that

He rais'd her from the ground, and aſſur'd her he would puniſh the guilty ſo ſoon as he came to a place where he made any ſtay: Soon after, the King made a Truce with the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,,</hi> and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Paris,</hi> carri'd Madam <hi>de Gigon</hi> along with him: he diſcover'd to her the Paſſion he had for her, and heap'd ſo many Favours upon her, that he ſoon made her forget her loſs. Nor was ſhe ungrateful, but ſignaliz'd her acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the expence of her Honour. She had one Daughter that was afterwards marry'd to the Baſtard of <hi>Bourbon.</hi> The cuſtom of that time was for Ladies to adorn themſelves with Jewels, and they wore Chains of Precious Stones, that came three or four times about their Necks.
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:53606:59"/> The King gave Order to a famous Jeweller, whoſe name was <hi>Paſſefilon,</hi> to make one of thoſe Chains for Madam <hi>Gigon;</hi> and the Jeweller's Wife carry'd it home to the King's Miſtreſs, ſo ſoon as it was finiſh'd. The King was then by accident in her Chamber, and found the Jewel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers Wife ſo lovely, that his Love for Madam <hi>Gigon,</hi> could not protect his Heart againſt her Charms. However, he could not diſcover his Paſſion in his Miſtreſſes Preſence, but comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Landais</hi> his Treaſurer to ſend her to him, when ſhe came to be paid for the Chain; telling him, that he would drive the bargain himſelf; which was a uſual thing for him to do, in regard, that being very covetous, he would be taking notice of the meaneſt trifles, to hinder his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers from making any advantage of their Places. Mrs. <hi>Paſſefilon,</hi> then, was admitted into his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet, and obſerving her but in an ordinary Dreſs, he told her in plain terms, without fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any great compaſs about, that if ſhe would comply with his Paſſion, ſhe ſhould gain more by him in a year, then ſhe could get as long as ſhe liv'd in her Shop. The Jewellers Wife, who lov'd Money, and had been a witneſs of the raiſing of Madam <hi>de Gigon,</hi> eaſily ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render'd to this Royal Temptation, and the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain was preſenly concluded. In a ſhort time ſhe grew big with Child, and brought the King an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Daughter, that was afterwards marry'd to <hi>Anthony de Bueil,</hi> Count of <hi>Sancerre.</hi> But when <hi>Paſſefilon</hi> ſaw that ſhe had wherewithal to live like a Lady, ſhe was as willing as others to

One day therefore, that the King came to pay her a viſit in a homely Suit, and a foul Shirt, Sir, ſaid ſhe, When I ſurrender'd my Heart to a King of <hi>France,</hi> I thought to have ſound in the Courtly commerce wherein I had embark'd my ſelf, all the Gayeties of Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Gallantry, that the Magnificence of the moſt noble Court in <hi>Europe</hi> could have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded; nevertheleſs, 'tis my grief, that when I have an eager deſire to abandon my ſelf to to the tranſports of a tender Paſſion; I ſmell nothing but ſlovenly Greaſe, where nothing but Muske and Amber ſhould perfume my Noſe.

The King was ſo amaz'd at this Curtain Lecture, that he had not the power to interrupt her; However, as he was a great diſſembler, he did not diſcover his diſguſt, tho he thought it high time to get him a more complaiſant Miſtreſs.

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:53606:61"/> which was the reaſon that ſhe reſolv'd to marry <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> Duke of <hi>Beaujou.</hi> Upon the firſt propoſal of it, that the King her Father made her, as ſhe was unwilling to be unfortunate alone, ſhe perſwaded <hi>Lewis</hi> XI. over whom ſhe had a powerful Aſcendant, to marry the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> to <hi>Joan</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> his Daughter, who was neither beautiful, nor of an agreeable tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.

'Tis true, that the Marriage was not conſummated, whether it were, that he had an averſion for the Princeſs, or that ſhe had ſome natural defects, as it was afterwards pretended, which hinder'd her having of Children. After the death of <hi>Lewis</hi> XI, the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> demanded the Regency, during the minority of <hi>Charles</hi> VIII. who was not above Thirteen years of age; but the Dutcheſs of <hi>Beaujou</hi> carry'd it before him. But thô ſhe had got this advantage, yet for all that ſhe could not chuſe but ſeek the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi>'s friendſhip, whom ſhe had not the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to hate, notwithſtanding his indifferency, and ſhe offer'd him a ſhare in the Government, if he would but live in a friendly correſpondence with her: but he return'd thoſe Anſwers, that ill became him to her civilities. Thereupon, the Dutcheſs exaſperated by his Contempt, ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died nothing ſo much, as which way to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd. She grounded her pretence upon a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel which the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> had had with the Duke of <hi>Lorraine,</hi> while he was playing at Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:53606:61"/> with him, and would have had the Duke ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended; but he withdrew to the Duke of <hi>Bretagne.</hi> In whoſe Court, while the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> reſided, he waited moſt ſedulouſly upon the Princeſs <hi>Ann</hi> his Daughter, and fell ſo deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in love with her, that he preſerv'd his Paſſion for her, till his death. In the mean time he enter'd into a ſtrict confederacy againſt the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs Regent, of which, himſelf, and the Duke of <hi>Bretagne</hi> were the Heads. They betook themſelves to Arms on both ſides, and they came to the deciſion of a Battle in the Plain of <hi>St. Aubin:</hi> where the Confederate Princes were defeated, and the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> being taken pris'ner, was afterwards lock'd up in the Tower of <hi>Bourges:</hi> nor was he releas'd till after <hi>Charles</hi> VIII. had eſpous'd <hi>Ann</hi> of <hi>Bretagne,</hi> and at the ſame time that the King was preparing for his expedition into <hi>Italy.</hi>

                     <hi>LEWIS</hi> of <hi>Orleans</hi> being come to the Crown, made it his whole ſtudy to marry the Princeſs <hi>Ann,</hi> Widow of <hi>Charles</hi> VIII. his Predeceſſor. He caus'd the Reaſons for the diſſolving of his Marriage with the Princeſs <hi>Joan</hi> to be laid before Pope <hi>Julius,</hi> as being uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ever bringing forth Succeſſors to the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:53606:62"/> Crown, and deſir'd a Diſpenſation from his Holineſs, to marry the fair Queen, whom he dearly lov'd. Nor would his impatience per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him to ſtay till he receiv'd the Diſpenſation: 'twas enough to hear by the Legate's Secretary, whom he had gain'd to his ſide, that it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd and drawing up. Yet for all this, the love of that Princeſs, ſurceas'd not to cauſe him new diſturbances. She became jealous of <hi>Louiſe</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> Counteſs of <hi>Angouleſme,</hi> Mother of <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt, and their hatred brake forth to that degree of exaſperation, that it divided the whole Court into Parties. <hi>Lewis</hi> XII. had a deſign to marry the Princeſs <hi>Claudia</hi> his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with the young Count of <hi>Angoulême,</hi> whom he look'd upon as his Succeſſor, but the Queen oppos'd it to the utmoſt of her power. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to croſs this deſign, ſhe reſolv'd to marry her with <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> who was already call'd Prince of <hi>Spain,</hi> and to give him <hi>Bretagne</hi> in favour of that Alliance. To this purpoſe, ſhe ſent privately a Gentleman of the Houſe of <hi>Rieux</hi> into <hi>Flanders,</hi> and thence into <hi>Germany.</hi> This Gentleman made the Propoſal to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Maximilian,</hi> the Prince's Grandfather, by the Father's ſide, and to <hi>Chieuvres,</hi> his Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. They agreed upon the Articles, which were Sign'd, and there remain'd nothing but the Ceremony of the Nuptials, which had been ſolemniz'd unknown to the King, had not the tender age of the Parties been an obſtacle to the Conſummation; and had it been in the power of the Queen to have diſpos'd of her
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:53606:62"/> Daughter as ſhe would her ſelf: to which end, fortune ſometime after gave her an opportunity, of which ſhe try'd to make her advantage.</p>
                  <p>The King falling ſick at <hi>Paris,</hi> his diſtemper increas'd to that degree, that the Phyſicians gave him over for loſt, and while the whole Court was in a conſternation upon the deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate condition of the King's health, the Queen took her opportunity privately, to ſend away her Daughter by water down the River <hi>Loire,</hi> to <hi>Nantes.</hi> But paſſing through <hi>Angiers,</hi> ſhe was ſtop'd by the Marſhal <hi>de Gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>,</hi> who was Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of that place. The Marſhal was one that took part with the Counteſs of <hi>Angoulême,</hi> and in regard, he was not ignorant that the Queen oppos'd the King's deſign of marrying <hi>Claudia,</hi> with the Son of that Princeſs, he ſoon conjectur'd the reaſon that his maſters Daughter was ſent away by that private conveyance, during his Sickneſs. Nor was he ignorant how prejudicial the conjunction of <hi>Bretagne</hi> to the Dominions of <hi>Spain,</hi> would be to <hi>France,</hi> which was the reaſon, that without many more to do, he reſolv'd to croſs a contrivance ſo dangerous, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he was aſſur'd that the Queen would never forgive him, ſhould the King happen to die of his Sickneſs. Thereupon he ſtopt the Princeſs,, with moſt reſpectful proteſtations of his ſorrow, for being conſtrain'd to come to that extremity. This action of the Marſhal was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by the King, and all good French men, and the Queen her ſelf feign'd to applaud it; however, when the King was recover'd, ſhe
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:53606:63"/> made uſe of her credit to ruin that faithful ſubject. Nevertheleſs ſhe could not prevent the marriage of her Daughter with the Count of <hi>Angoulême,</hi> becauſe it was generally deſir'd. But it was ſuch an inward vexation to her, that ſinking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the weight of her corroding anguiſh, ſhe dy'd in the thirty ſeven Year of her age. 'Tis true, the King did not expreſs that ſorrow for her death, as 'tis thought he would have done, conſidering the paſſion he had for her, as long as ſhe liv'd: whither it were that his mind was taken up with his cares of the Wars of <hi>Italy,</hi> or that the Queen's attempts againſt his authority, had cool'd the heat of his Love. However af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, he liv'd ſuch a reſerv'd life, that no body believ'd he would ever have thought of a third Marriage; but the Duke of <hi>Longueville</hi> was the occaſion of reviving that deſire in him.</p>
                  <p>That Prince having raſhly engag'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a battle againſt the Engliſh, <label type="milestone">

For thô he were very young, he was very thrifty, and he was a weary of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Emperours Troops, who was extreamly poor; and of furniſhing him a hundred Crowns a day for his table. There only wanted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a plauſible pretence to break the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy; and there was not a better at that time
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:53606:63"/> to be found, then a more ſtrict alliance between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Henry VIII.</hi> had a Siſter whoſe beauty was a domeſtick miſchief to him, as we ſhall find in the ſequel of this hiſtory. She was born after another Daughter, ſo much unprovided of the graces of the body, that the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver marry'd her, but becauſe the King would not marry the youngeſt before the eldeſt. The young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt being come of Age, the Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> and ſeveral other Sovereign Princes ſought her in vain, becauſe 'twas not then the cuſtom to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the King's Daughter, out of the Iſland. This cuſtome, which had not been alter'd for four Ages together, had infus'd into the young En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Lords of the higheſt Quality, a confidence to pretend to the Princeſs, and the King gave way to it, leſt he ſhould be accus'd of too much ſeverity toward his Siſter; tho' he had no deſign to have marry'd her to any of his ſubjects, for fear of drawing a civil War upon himſelf, not unlike to thoſe wherein ſeveral of his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors had miſcarry'd. Nevertheleſs, in regard it is a difficult thing for a Woman to hold out any long time againſt Love, when ſhe makes it her buſineſs to allure, the Princeſs of <hi>England,</hi> after ſhe had entangl'd in the ſnares of Love, all thoſe that could give any cauſe of jealouſy to her Brother, was her ſelf ſmitten with one, whom he had little reaſon to fear. There was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd into the Court of <hi>England,</hi> a young En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Gentleman, whoſe name was <hi>Charles Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> without any other recommendation, then
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:53606:64"/> that of the King's Nurſe, whoſe Son he was. He was extreamly handſome, well proportion'd in his perſon, and very active in all manner of exerciſes. He had the air of a perſon of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; and there was obſerv'd in him that ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of temper, and that diſcretion, that he was welcome into all ſocieties, and chiefly into the Ladies company, who were altogether pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent at Court. The King took him for his ſecond in all his matches at Tenis, and made him the confident of all his moſt ſecret pleaſures. He conferr'd upon him the office of his chief Hunts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and leſt his name ſhould remind the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of the meaneſs of his Birth, he caus'd him to aſſume the title of the Counts of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious for the merit and quality of the perſons who had born it, for above two hundred years. It is not certainly known, whether this new ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle had convinc'd the Princeſs, that ſhe might, beſtow her affection without any diſhonour, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the perſon whom the King her Brother had honour'd with it; ſince the Engliſh Hiſtories are full of preſidents of ſeveral Earls of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> that have pretended to the marriage of the Siſters and Daughters of their King's; or whether the Love which ſhe already had for him, had imprint<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed that Idea in her mind in his favour; but it was obſerv'd, that in a ſhort time after the Princeſs lookt upon <hi>Suffolk</hi> with a more paſſionate glance, then ſhe was wont to do.</p>
                  <p>Nor wat it ſo much to be wonder'd at, that the Earle ſhould make her ſuitable returns, with Eyes no leſs inflam'd and ſparkling. And the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:53606:64"/> Courtiers in a little time were ſo us'd to it, that they took little notice of it: whether it were the cuſtome at that time, to love at well beneath as above their quality, or whether it were, that the Courtiers thought it not proper to be more concern'd about it, then the King himſelf was, who only laught at the buſineſs, and made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf merry with the two lovers, ſo ſoon as he diſcover'd their reciprocal affection. Not that he approv'd it in the main, or that he had ſo high a value for <hi>Suffolk,</hi> as to make him his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Law, (thô he had a greater kindneſs for him, then for the reſt of his Courtiers.) But he was in hopes to draw ſome advantage from the inequality of this Amour, which he thought would exaſperate the Engliſh Lords againſt her, and cauſe 'em to deſiſt from looking any more after her; beſides that, he aſſur'd himſelf that he ſhould be ſo much the maſter of his Siſter, and <hi>Suffolk,</hi> that nothing ſhould be acted between them two, but by his conſent.</p>
                  <p>This was the poſture of the Court of <hi>England,</hi> when the Duke of <hi>Longueville</hi> made a propoſal as from himſelf, of a match between the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and <hi>Lewis XII.</hi> The King of <hi>England</hi> liſten'd to him with thoſe marks of reſpect and approbation, which ſuficiently diſcover'd what he had in his Heart. He was importun'd to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow his Siſter out of the way, and he met with the moſt lucky means that Fortune ever could have offer'd him. 'Tis true, he could not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome trouble to himſelf, put an end to a War ſo advantageous to him, however it would
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:53606:65"/> have been no leſs a vexation to him, to ſeparate from his new Miſtreſs, who would have been unwilling to croſs the Seas, and follow him in his Armies.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time he was engag'd to repaſs into <hi>France,</hi> upon the return of the Spring, not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but that if he fail'd in his promiſe, both his Enemies and his own Souldiers would accuſe him of Cowardice. There was nothing but a Peace that could handſomly diſingage him from that exceſſive expence which he would be oblig'd to be at, if he intended to keep the Emperors Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in pay the next Spring. In ſhort, he grew weary of contributing to the ambitious deſigns of the King of Spain, his Brother in Law, yet getting nothing by it, and contented himſelf with having been twice deceiv'd by as many Treaties ſign'd by his Ambaſſador <hi>Quintana,</hi> as ſuttle a Fox of a Caſtilian, as ever was born. Nevertheleſs the King of <hi>England</hi> being haughty, told the Duke of <hi>Longueville,</hi> that it would be time enough to think of his Siſter, when ſhe ſhould be demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in due form. As much as to ſay, that it was not from the mouth of a Priſoner that the King was to take notice of any propoſal of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Longueville</hi> gave a ſhrewd gueſs at the King's thoughts, and ſent into <hi>France,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of ſending for his ranſome, a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman who aſſur'd <hi>Lewis XII.</hi> that it would be his own fault if he did not make a Peace with <hi>England</hi> upon reaſonable conditions, and marry the King's Siſter, who was the moſt lovely Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:53606:65"/> in <hi>Europe. Lewis,</hi> who had always an amou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous inclination, willingly entertain'd the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, and the portraiture of the Princeſs, that was ſent him, was too powerful a charm to let his affection for the Female Sex lie dormant. He flatter'd himſelf alſo with the hopes of having a Son, and caſting off all his former fears, of the inconveniencies that might befall him, if <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagne</hi> were ſeparated from the Crown, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patcht into <hi>England</hi> the General of <hi>Normandy,</hi> who concluded both the Peace and the Match in fifteen days, and carry'd the Princeſs to <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logne,</hi> where the Count of <hi>Angoulême,</hi> had Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to go and receive her.</p>
                  <p>The Count moſt gladly undertook and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd his truſt, thô the marriage which he ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemniz'd by procuration from the King was the way, in all probability to deprive him of the Crown. However, <hi>Francines,</hi> the King's chief Phyſician, aſſur'd him that the King was very unlikely to have any more Children. So that he appear'd at <hi>Boulogne</hi> like a Prince, who only minded his divertiſement; at what time, he could not forbear falling in Love with her, whom he marry'd for his Father in Law, as ſhe could not chuſe but wiſh, that Heaven had ordain'd the Count for her Husband. And the convenience which they had to entertain each other with pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Converſation, might perhaps have promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted 'em to have taken a far greater liberty, if the Prothonotary <hi>du Pont,</hi> who was plac'd near the Prince to moderate in ſome meaſure the tranſports of his youth, had not put it into his head, that 'twas not the new Queen's intereſt,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:53606:66"/> to keep her ſelf very cbaſt; becauſe that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard ſhe was going to a Husband, by whom, as all People ſaid, ſhe would never have any Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, 'twas to be fear'd ſhe would ſubmit to a temptation that might help her to a Child, for the preſervation of her race in <hi>France,</hi> when ſhe came to he a Widow, and diſpence with her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into <hi>England,</hi> under ſubjection to her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but that as for himſelf, it concern'd him above all Men, to take care of the Queen's liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chaſtily, as being a thing far remote from his Intereſt, to ſollicite her to incontinence: for that if ſhe had a Son by him, that Son would hinder him from coming to the Crown, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him to be contented with <hi>Bretagne,</hi> which his Wife had brought him, while he contrary to the order of nature, muſt: be forc'd to do Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to a Baſtard. This reaſon cool'd the Count of <hi>Angoulême's</hi> courage, and caus'd him to look upon the Queen with no other then jealous Eyes: and he watch'd her ſo narrowly, that at length he diſcover'd the kindneſs ſhe had for <hi>Suffolk.</hi> He follow'd her with the character of her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion of Honour, but carry'd himſelf with that diſcretion, that they could have never penetrated into his affairs, had they not been already diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Count underſtood every thing ſo well, that the ſlighteſt circumſtances were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd from him, and becauſe it was no leſs then either the loſs or gaining of a Crown, that was now in agitation, he ſought an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to ſpeak with <hi>Suffolk</hi> in private. He told
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:53606:66"/> him that he was well acquainted with his good correſpondence with the Queen, and that he was ſo far from breaking it off, that he would coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance him in it, provided he might be no looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by it: that the King was not in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ondition to have Children, nor to live long: that <hi>Suffolk</hi> could never think of making any progreſſes in the Queen's favour, without expoſing himſelf to the danger of being diſcover'd, by a multitude of ſpies that would never looſe ſight of him; ſo that if he took never ſo little liberty, he was a loſt Man paſt all redemption. On the otherſide, if he would give him aſſurance to contain himſelf within the bounds of reſpect, he would engage never to croſs his good fortune after the King's death, nay he would connive at his marrying the Queen in private, and allow him an eſtabliſhment in <hi>France,</hi> as good as he could deſire, till he could make his peace with the King of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thô the Duke of <hi>Angoulême</hi> never conſider'd at the time of his making thoſe propoſals, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he could be as good as his word, when he came to the Crown, <hi>Suffolke</hi> found 'em ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous, that he was charm'd with 'em, and accepted of 'em as real performances. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd more then the Duke demanded, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to be himſelf a Spy upon the Queen. But, in regard it would have been a piece of impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to have wholly confided in his Word, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions were taken to hinder him from breach of Faith, ſhould he have gone about to have violated his promiſe. The Baroneſs of <hi>Aumont</hi> was made of Honour to the Queen, and became
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:53606:67"/> her moſt intimate Confident. And it was by the advice of the Queen, that ſhe enlarg'd the functions of her Office, beyond the uſual bounds; and that knowing the Queen to be fearful and unwilling to lie alone, ſhe pretended that the Honour of lying with the Queen in the King's abſence, belong'd to her, and carry'd it, to the excluſion of all the Ladies which the Queen brought with her out of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now becauſe the Count of <hi>Angoulême</hi>'s Friends thought it abſolutely neceſſary, that he ſhould have ſecret and faithful Spies about the Queen; Madame, and the Baroneſs <hi>d'Aumont</hi> undertook that Province, and divided their time ſo exactly between 'em, that either the one or the other was always by her; nor did ſhe ever ſuſpect the true Reaſon, for that ſhe had much more Beauty then Wit. The Baroneſs cover'd their ſedulity with the fair pretence of that Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which they ſaid they were oblig'd to pay her, the one as her Daughter-in-law, the other, as her Maid of Honour. There was only <hi>Suffolk</hi> who was ſo quick-ſighted as to perceive their deſign: but in regard he found at the ſame time they took care to conceal it, he rather choſe to feign ignorance, then to give the Queen no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it, for fear the Count ſhould ſeek his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, as taking from thence, an occaſion to tax him with breach of Promiſe.</p>
                  <p>This was the poſture of the Intreagues at Court, when the King dy'd, the Firſt day of the year 1515. ſix Weeks or thereabout after his Nuptials. However, the Queen was obſerv'd
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:53606:67"/> with the ſame exactneſs as before, ſo long as there was any reaſon to doubt whether ſhe was with Child, or no. But after ſhe had declar'd her ſelf free, and that that they were aſſur'd by undeniable proofs; that her Declaration was ſincere, the Count of <hi>Angoulême</hi> being advanc'd to the Crown, by the name of <hi>Francis</hi> I. was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to keep his word exactly with <hi>Suffolk.</hi> To which purpoſe he ſpoke of it in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; at what time his Miniſters endeavour'd to divert him from it, laying before him, that it would be the committing a fault at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his Reign, which was never to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd, and an unſurmountable obſtacle to his deſigns of marching into <hi>Italy</hi> for the recovery of the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> which his predeceſſors had loſt; and that it behov'd him before his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, to ſecure himſelf againſt his neighbours, more eſpecially the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who were moſt of all to be fear'd: that <hi>Hen.</hi> VIII. was the moſt haughty Monarch in <hi>Europe,</hi> and that it would be the moſt ſenſible injury that could be done him, to permit an inferior Marriage of his Siſter. However, the conſideration of Honour was more predominant over <hi>Francis</hi> I. then his own Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts. He ſuffer'd <hi>Suffolk</hi> to marry the Queen Dowager privately, and the King of <hi>England,</hi> whoſe haughty Paſſion was ſometimes ſoften'd by a capricious Humour, which at times got the upper hand of him, conſented to the Marriage when it could not be undone, which he never would have permitted before the knot was knit. His tender kindneſs for <hi>Suffolk</hi> reviv'd in him,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:53606:68"/> when he ſaw him guilty of a crime, which it behov'd him, either abſolutely to pardon, or to cut of his Head: and that Love, which he could not brook one day himſelf, without diſcovering it to the Party that was the occaſion of it, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd him indulgent to his Siſter, who had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born to ſatisfie her own Affection, till her Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowhood gave her permiſſion. Thereupon he pardon'd 'em both, conſented to her ſecond marriage, ſent for her into <hi>England,</hi> ſo ſoon as he had ſecur'd her Dowry of 60000 Livres a year, and renew'd his Alliance with <hi>Francis</hi> I. upon the conditions, that he had ſign'd to <hi>Lewis</hi> XII.</p>

                     <hi>FRANCIS</hi> I. was a Prince endow'd with all thoſe qualities that were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to make a Great Monarch. He was mild and eaſie, liberal and magnificent in all things, and moreover, a comely handſome Perſon. He had a quick Wit, and a true Judgment, he was ſtout, and undaunted in danger, indefatigable in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and conſtant in ill fortune; he was a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of Learning, and had a great value for Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men. With all theſe great Talents, it was to be thought that he would have carry'd on his Conqueſts far and near, had not his exceſſive
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:53606:68"/> compliances with his Mother, and his indulgence to his Miſtreſſes, caus'd him to commit thoſe faults, from which he had much adoe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem himſelf. His extraordinary Expences up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on voluptuous Feaſts, had ſo exhauſted his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that he wanted Money for his neceſſary Exigencies. The Love of the Counteſs of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goulême</hi> for the Conſtable of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> and her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite to find that he did not correſpond with her Paſſion, carry'd her to thoſe extremities, that he was forc'd to throw himſelf into the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> Arms, to deliver himſelf from her perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The choice which <hi>Francis</hi> I. made of the Brothers of his firſt Miſtreſs, to command his Armies in <hi>Italy,</hi> occaſion'd the loſs of all his Conqueſts; and the Intelligence which the Second held with the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> V. to make him her Protector againſt <hi>Diana</hi> of <hi>Poictiers,</hi> the Dauphin's Miſtreſs, reduc'd him to make an ignominious Peace with the <hi>Spaniasds.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The object of his firſt Amours, after his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the Crown, was the Counteſs of <hi>Châ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teau Brian.</hi> She was the Daughter of <hi>Phoebus de Grailly,</hi> a Prince of the Houſe of <hi>Foix;</hi> a Perſon who had all the Graces both of Body and Mind, that could cauſe a Woman to be belov'd. The Count of <hi>Château Brian</hi> ſought her in Marriage, when ſhe was but Twelve years of age, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>ure hid, which he conceal'd ſo long in a corner
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:53606:69"/> of <hi>Bretaigne;</hi> but noiſe and rumour is as inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable from accompliſh'd Beauties, as the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow from ſubſtance. The King was eaſily over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rul'd by his own Inclination, or by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs of <hi>Angoulême,</hi> his Mother, to permit the introducing thoſe Ladies into Court, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver appear'd there before, but upon great Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, and the Count of <hi>Chateau-Brian</hi> was invited to bring his Wife thither, who was to be the principal Ornament of it. He excus'd it however a long time, whether he were jealous, or whether he had any ſecret Prognoſticks with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himſelf of what would befall him.</p>
                  <p>His evaſions were ſo courtly, and accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd with ſo many probable circumſtances, that they afforded no occaſion to miſtruſt 'em of Artifice. He laid all the fault upon the moroſe humour of his Wife, which it was impoſſible to tame: but all his foreſight could not prevent the deſtiny which the Stars had allotted him. An unexpected Affair, wherein his whole Eſtate was concern'd, call'd him of neceſſity to Court, and forc'd him from <hi>Bretaigne,</hi> where he would have thought himſelf a happy Man to have ſpent all his days.</p>
                  <p>Now, in regard he foreſaw that his ſtay at Court would be of long continuance, he put his Invention upon the Rack, to find out an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient which way to avoid the King's importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, yet without depriving himſelf the liberty of ſending for her, when he pleas'd himſelf. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had weigh'd and conſider'd ſeveral, he could not think of any better, then to cauſe
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:53606:69"/> two Jewels to be made of a fantaſtic faſhion, yet ſo like as not to be diſtinguiſh'd one from the other, and to make uſe of one to let his Wife underſtand his intentions. One he kept himſelf, the other he gave the Counteſs, telling her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al that he was going to Court, whether he ſhould be conſtrain'd to ſend for her; but that ſhe ſhould give credit to none of his Letters, if ſhe did not find the Jewel, which he kept himſelf, incloſed within in it. The Counteſs never made many reflexions upon her Husbands endocuments, for that having always liv'd above a hundred Leagues from Court, ſhe was neither acquainted with the divertiſements, nor the dangers of it. So that ſhe only lock'd up the Jewel, and made a promiſe of Obedience to her Husband.</p>
                  <p>The Count was moſt graciouſly receiv'd by the King, yet gently chiding him now and then for not having brought his Wife along with him; but having a great deal of Wit, he excus'd himſelf as long as he could, without making any promiſe. Afterwards he made as if he were willing to leave it to the Counteſs to do as ſhe pleas'd her ſelf, and wrote to her in the very Language that the Court preſcrib'd him: but becauſe ſhe ſaw no Jewel, ſhe ſtill anſwer'd with ſome evaſion or other.</p>
                  <p>This colluſion had continu'd much longer, had not the Count betraid his own Secret. But he was govern'd altogether by one of his <hi>Valets de cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre,</hi> from whom he kept nothing conceal'd; now that Servant ſeeing him ſet ſuch a value upon a Jewel that did not ſeem to be very rich, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:53606:70"/> the reaſon of it; becauſe, ſaid the Count, very imprudently, it contains the Secret, which way to make my Wife come to Court.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Valet de chambre</hi> did not preſently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the meaning of his Maſters words, but after he had ponder'd 'em for ſome time in his Mind, he gave a ſhrewd conjecture at a good part of the Truth; and as he had been tempted ſeveral times to ſerve the Court to his Maſter's prejudice, he went to find out thoſe that had ſounded him, and told 'em, he could put into their hands the only infallible means to ſend for his Miſtriſs, and to bring her up to Court, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, he might be ſecur'd of a Livelyhood, if the Count ſhould turn him out of his Service. The bargain was made, and the Jewel was ſtollen, and deliver'd to an expert Artiſt, who made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſo like it, that the <hi>Valet</hi> himſelf could not diſcern the one from the other. Thereupon the Counterfeit was intermix'd among the reſt of the King's Jewels, and the true one was kept, to fetch the Counteſs from her ſolitary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.</p>
                  <p>This done, they told the Count, that they could never believe that he wrote ſincerely to his Lady to come to Court, and upon his offer to make uſe of the moſt moving and tender ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, and to deliver his Letter to any Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger they ſhould make choice of; he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at his word, and the Jewel was ſeal'd up in the Letter. The Counteſs deluded by this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice, departed from <hi>Chateau-Brian,</hi> and made ſo much haſte, that her Husband ſaw her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:53606:70"/> he knew that ſhe was ſent for. But he was not ſo much ſurpriz'd, however, at her arrival, as at the two Jewels which ſhe ſhew'd him, and then he founnd that he was betraid; but he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver call'd to mind that he himſelf had been the occaſion of it. He accus'd Heaven for the fault which himſelf had committed, and immediately departed, in order to his return into <hi>Bretain,</hi> for fear of being the witneſs of his own ſhame.</p>
                  <p>The Counteſs thus abandon'd by him, whom it moſt concern'd to preſerve her Honour, did no more then what m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ght well be expected from a Virtue that never was put to the Tryal. She reſiſted for ſome time, but at length ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render'd to the King's importunities. She had at firſt a very great Aſcendant over the King, and ſhe might have advanc'd her Husband to the chiefeſt Imployments in the Kingdom, had he been of a humour to prefer Ambition before Honour; but he ſtill refus'd what he ſuſpected was was only offer'd him for his Wives ſake; nor would he ever hear talk of her under any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence whatever.</p>
                  <p>When the Counteſs ſaw, that her Husband withſtood with ſo much obſtinacy, whatever ſhe did to advance his Fortune, ſhe bethought her ſelf of ſetting up her two Brothers. They were both as ſtout as ſhe was Fair: and ſhe caus'd the Government of <hi>Milanois</hi> to be given to <hi>Lautrec,</hi> who was the eldeſt; after the Conſtable of <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon</hi> was diſmiſs'd from his imployment. And it was given out, that all was done to do juſtice to his Deſerts, and to recompenſe him for Two and
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:53606:71"/> twenty wounds that he had receiv'd at the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of <hi>Ravanna,</hi> fighting to ſave the Life of <hi>Gaſton de Foix,</hi> his Couſin German Nevertheleſs, 'tis certain, that if the Counteſs of <hi>Chateau-Brian</hi> had not been his Siſter, he had never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd that imployment, becauſe the King knew him to be a Man fix'd to his own Opinion, and one that would never ſubmit to the Counſels of thoſe who had more experience then himſelf. His negligence was the reaſon that Pope <hi>Leo</hi> X. loſt the Dutchie of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin,</hi> which made him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of the Alliance he had made with <hi>France,</hi> and of which he made heavy complaints to the King. <hi>Trivultio</hi> alſo, who was one of the greateſt Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of his Age, becauſe, that ſeeing <hi>Lautrec</hi>'s faults, he took the liberty to ſchool him, was turn'd out of Favour. The Counteſs of <hi>Chateau-Brian,</hi> caus'd him to be recall'd at the ſollicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her Brother, and he came to Court to juſtifie himſelf againſt ſeveral Crimes that were laid to his Chatge: but he was ſo ill receiv'd by the King, that it broke his Heart, and he dy'd with Grief. Thus you ſee how this Prince, prepoſſeſs'd by his Miſtreſſes, entruſted the Command of his Armies with perſons, unable to manage ſuch great imployments, and ſlighted thoſe that were able to do him profitable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lautrec</hi> therefore having done nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable in <hi>Italy,</hi> return'd to Court to marry the Heireſs of <hi>Orval Teligny,</hi> whom he had left at <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> to Command there in his room, by his good Conduct, repair'd the diſorders which his impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:53606:71"/> had caus'd, and the People appear'd ſo well ſatisfi'd, that there was good reaſon to hope that all things would have gone well. But the King's Complacency for the Counteſs, ſpoyl'd all again. She perſwaded <hi>Leſent</hi> her youngeſt Brother, made Biſhop of <hi>Aire,</hi> to quit his Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſock, and obtain'd the ſame employment for him, while <hi>Lautrec</hi> minded his own Domeſtick affairs in <hi>Guyenne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Leſent</hi> had all the virtues and all the vices which are commonly attributed to the <hi>Beruois</hi> his Countrymen. His courage was undaunted, and he never appear'd with more a chearfull courage, then when he was to look the greateſt dangers in the Face: but in exchange, he was highly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptive, prodigal to exceſs, and theſe were two defects, the moſt contrary that could be to the Genius of the Italians, whom he was to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern. The firſt render'd him contemptible to the Nobility, and the ſecond made him, for ſlight offences, confiſcate the Eſtates of ſeveral wealthy Families, without any other motive then to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his Pomp and Luxury; ſo that he prov'd as unfortunate in the adminiſtration of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment as his Brother. When the news came to Court, that the Pope had quitted his allyance with <hi>France, Lautrec</hi> was commanded to return to his Government. He made ſome ſcruple at firſt out of a ſecret miſdoubting before hand, the ill ſucceſs of his journey. He knew there was no Money in the Royal Treaſury, and yet he requir'd three hundred thouſand Crowns, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, he proteſted that the Dutchy of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi>
                     <pb n="138" facs="tcp:53606:72"/> could not be preſerv'd. But at length his Siſters tears, and the King's abſolute orders ſhe deliver'd to his hands, oblig'd him to take Poſt, after that <hi>Semblançay,</hi> the King's Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer had ſworn to him, that he ſhould no ſooner arrive at <hi>Milan,</hi> but he ſhould receive bills of Exchange for the Sum he demanded.</p>
                  <p>But the ill omen that attended his arrival, was enough to have terrifi'd a courage leſs undaunted then his. For a flaſh of Lightning ſet on Fire the Tower of the Caſtle of <hi>Milan,</hi> where the Powder lay, and blowing it up into the Air, in a ſolid bulk, overturn'd it after ſo odd a manner, that the top fell lowermoſt, and the Foundation ſtood uppermoſt. The reſt of the ſtructure was ſo ſhaken, that the French who were ſettl'd in <hi>Milan,</hi> and the Senators were conſtrain'd to keep watch, whole Nights together, till the Gariſon was reinforc'd. The firſt Action then, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <hi>Lautrec</hi> ſignaliz'd his return, was the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of <hi>Pallavicini,</hi> the Popes kinſman, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd of holding correſpondence with the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, whoſe Head he caus'd to be cut from his Shoulders, and gave the confiſcation of his Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, amounting to 20000 Crowns a year, to his Brother <hi>Leſeut,</hi> who was then call'd the Marſhal <hi>de Foix,</hi> which only ſerv'd to incenſe the moſt conſiderable Families of <hi>Milan</hi> againſt him, and to render his Government more odious.</p>
                  <p>But notwithſtanding the averſion of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and the People to the French, <hi>Lautrec</hi> might have preſerv'd the ſtrong holds within his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, could he but have retain'd the Swiſſes,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:53606:72"/> that were the chiefeſt ſtrength of his Infantery, but not being able to pay 'em what was their due, the Cardinal of <hi>Sion</hi> found a way to debauch 'em, by ſupplying 'em with the ſame Sum. <hi>Lautrec</hi> foreſaw this inconvenience, and might have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided it, had the Court of <hi>France</hi> been as good as their word. But the 300000 Crowns which he was to have receiv'd at his arrival at <hi>Milan,</hi> not being ſent, and the Contributions which he drew from the Country not ſufficeing for his Men, he was reduc'd to looſe the flower of his Infantry, for want of five and twenty thouſand Crowns.</p>
                  <p>The King rely'd upon his Mother for the ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Money into <hi>Italy.</hi> But ſhe, who ſaw that her Son began to do at every Day more then other upon the Counteſs of <hi>Chaſteau-Brian,</hi> was afraid leaſt ſhe ſhould ſupplant her in what concern'd the Principal Government of affairs. And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſhe might have been provok'd to take ſome unhappy reſolution againſt the Counteſs, if <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivet</hi> had not ſtop'd her, by telling her that an unſeaſonable violence, would gather augment, then cure the King's paſſion. And that conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration made her have recourſe to deſtroy the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of that Female favourite. To that purpoſe ſhe made choice of a way that ſeem'd leſs hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous, thô moſt prejudicial to the Crown; which was to render her Brother odious, by ruining the ſucceſs of their endeavours for the defence of the Milanois, committed to their care. This ſhe thought an infallible way, ſince the King's aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which they would incurr by the loſs of that
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:53606:73"/> Dutchy, the faireſt in Chriſtendom, would not fail to reflect upon their Loyalty, who had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd 'em the Government of it.</p>
                  <p>With this deſign, the Counteſs of <hi>Angoulême,</hi> the ſame Day that <hi>Lautrec</hi> departed from <hi>Paris,</hi> paid away the Money that was deſign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d him to another uſe; under pretence of Penſions and other gifts, charg'd upon the five greater Farms, And when <hi>Semblancy</hi> endeavour'd to oppoſe it, ſhe deliver'd him an Acquittance, and told him that the Authority which Nature had given her over her Son, was enough to ſecure a Treaſurer from being call'd to any accompt. <hi>Semblancy</hi> was either ſo credulous or ſo timorous, that he ſuffer'd the Princeſs to carry away the Money, and thought it a ſufficient diſpenſation, for the Oaths that he had ſworn to <hi>Lautrec;</hi> ſo ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a Man is to deceive himſelf, when he is afraid of looſing his employment.</p>
                  <p>What the Counteſs of <hi>Angoulême</hi> had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen, fell out: for the Souldiers that were in <hi>Milanois</hi> disbanded for want of their pay. <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres,</hi> after he had loſt the principal ſtrong holds within his Government, return'd into <hi>France</hi> with two of his Domeſtick Servants only, and paſs'd in diſguiſe through the Cantons of the Swiſſes. The King refus'd at firſt to ſee him, nor would he admit him into his preſence, till the Counteſs of <hi>Bourbon</hi> had aſſur'd him, that he had where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal fully to juſtify himſelf, and that he came to diſcover thoſe ſecrets, which were of great importance for His Majeſty to underſtand. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he was introduc'd into a full Council,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:53606:73"/> where no leſs haughty then ever, he could not forbear complaining of the King's frowning up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. <hi>Francis</hi> I. made anſwer, that a Man, who had loſt in one Campagne, all the Conqueſts that he had won in <hi>Italy,</hi> deſerv'd no other uſage; to which <hi>Lautrec</hi> reply'd, without ſeeming to be any way concern'd, that 't was an eaſie thing to know, who was the cauſe of all the miſchief.</p>
                  <p>The King imagining that he would lay the blame upon him, as'd him after a ſcornful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and as it were to upbraid him, whither he had not receiv'd the 400000 Crowns, that were ſent him by the way of <hi>Genoa?</hi> To which <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trec</hi> repli'd, that indeed he had receiv'd Letters of advice, that Money ſhould be ſent him, but that he had never ſeen a Farthing. At thoſe words the King ſtood like one in an amaze, at what time, <hi>Lautrec</hi> unwilling to looſe the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to inform him of the Truth, added with a reſolute utterance, that no way betoken'd guilt, that he had often writ to His Majeſty, that his Infantery, for the moſt part compos'd of Souldiers altogether mercinary, would infallibly Deſert, if they were not pay'd by ſuch a time; that the French Cavalry, Loyal and Conſtant beyond expreſſion, had ſerv'd Eighteen Months without receiving ſo much as one Muſter, but that the <hi>Swiſſes,</hi> who were no Subjects of <hi>France,</hi> did not think themſelves bound to follow their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> that he lead the remainder of his Army into the territory of the <hi>Firm-land,</hi> but that the Venetians grew weary of ſupplying 'em, and had ſent him word by the Proveditor <hi>Gritti,</hi> that
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:53606:74"/> they were no more oblig'd to preſerve <hi>Milanoiſe</hi> for the French, then the moſt Chriſtian King who took no care of it. Upon which he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodg'd without ſounding ſo much as a Trumpet, leſt they ſhould have ſtop'd him, and deliver'd him up to the Enemy, in hopes of making their Peace.</p>
                  <p>By this time the King being recover'd from his aſtoniſhment, interrupted <hi>Lautrec,</hi> telling him that he could not but acknowledge the receipt of the 3OOOOO Crowns, that <hi>Semblançay</hi> had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken in his preſence to pay him at <hi>Milan.</hi> To which <hi>Lautrec</hi> reply'd, that he had not receiv'd a doite either of the one or the t'other Sum; which put the King into a paſſion no leſs juſt, then it was violent. <hi>Semblançay</hi> was ſent for, while the King in the mean while ſeeking to pick a quarrel with <hi>Lautrec,</hi> told him after an inſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner, that <hi>Colonna</hi> and <hi>Peſcara,</hi> were no better aſſiſted with Men and Money then he, yet they had found a way to drive him before 'em; and therefore why could not he find a way to defend himſelf without Money which was the eaſier thing of the two. <hi>Lautrec</hi> anſwer'd very modeſtly, that to make the compariſon true, twas requiſite, that the <hi>Milaneſes</hi> ſhould have no more kindneſs for one party then another. Which might ſo fall out under the Reign of <hi>Lew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is</hi> XII. when the French being exactly paid, liv'd civily and peaceably among 'em. But the Army being grown licentious for want of pay, the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians had conceiv'd ſuch a hatred of 'em, that was only to be ſatisfi'd by opening their Bellies,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:53606:74"/> and tearing out their Hearts, as had happen'd in <hi>Navarr</hi> and other places. Immediately upon theſe words, <hi>Semblançay</hi> came into the Council Room; but the King inſtead of calling him Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as he was wont to do, look'd aſkew upon him, and ask'd him why he had not paid <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trec</hi> the 300000 Crowns which he had ſo ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promis'd. <hi>Semblançay,</hi> who knew not the danger he was in, anſwer'd with that Ingenuity which was natural to him, that the ſame Day the Aſſignations for <hi>Milanois</hi> were drawn up, His Majeſties Mother came to the Treaſury, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be paid for all that was due to her, till that very time, as well for Penſions and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications, as for the Dutchy of <hi>Valois, Tourcine,</hi> and <hi>Anjou,</hi> of which ſhe was the Donee: that he repreſented to her, that by the paying away ſo great a Sum all at a time, the Royal Treaſury would be exhauſted, and the Funds appointed for the Dutchy of <hi>Milan</hi> be deliver'd another way, contrary to what the King had order'd that Morning in her hearing, and to which ſhe had conſented; yet the Princeſs continu'd obſtinate in her pretenſions, and threatned to ruin him, if he did not let her have what ſhe demanded: and whereas he declar'd to her, that it was as much as his head was worth, if <hi>Lautrec</hi> did not find the Money ready upon his arrival at <hi>Milan,</hi> ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, that ſhe had credit enough with the King to ſecure him from any proſecution; and that if he ſhould be call'd to an accompt for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Money another way, that was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd for <hi>Italy,</hi> he ſhould ſay, that 'twas done
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:53606:75"/> by her Order. Thereupon the King, to clear the diſpute, ſent for his Mother, and <hi>Semblan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>çay</hi> repeated in her hearing, what he had ſaid; which put her into ſuch a rage, that the reſpect which ſhe ow'd to her Son, could not reſtrain her from giving the Treaſurer the lye, and demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſtice of the King, againſt a hair brain'd Fellow, that went about to make her guilty of High Treaſon. But in regard, they had the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittances which ſhe left in the Treaſury to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy her receite of the Money deſign'd for <hi>Lautrec,</hi> ſhe confeſs'd that ſhe demanded the payment of her Penſions, but ſhe ſtood it out, that <hi>Semblan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>çay</hi> when he gave her the Money, never told her that it was order'd for <hi>Milan.</hi> She deni'd all the reſt that <hi>Semblançay</hi> had ſaid, and demanded his Impriſonment with ſo much heat, that the King was forc'd to cauſe him to be arreſted in the Antichamber.</p>
                  <p>The buſineſs being thus clear'd up, it appear'd that <hi>Lautrec</hi> was Innocent, and all the blame fell upon <hi>Semblançay;</hi> upon which, the Chancellor <hi>du Prat,</hi> a Creature of the Counteſſes, the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident <hi>Gentil,</hi> and certain Counſellor who were the Chancellors Friends, being appointed to try the Treaſurer condemn'd him to Death, and he was publickly Executed.

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:53606:75"/> produc'd.

The ſtory was thus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> Conſtable of <hi>France,</hi> was the ſecond of Three Sons of <hi>Gilbert Montpenſier,</hi> and <hi>Clarice Gonzaga;</hi> that is to ſay, he deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended from the only branch of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> that was unfortunate. His Father had loſt his Life and reputation in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> where <hi>Charles</hi> the VIII. had left him Viceroy. His el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Brother expir'd for grief upon his Fathers Tomb, and the youngeſt was ſlain at the Battle of <hi>Marignon.</hi> As for himſelf, he appear'd at Court toward the end of the Reign of <hi>Lewis</hi> XII. when <hi>Claudia</hi> of <hi>France</hi> was marry'd. The tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament matches, and the divertiſements at that time, gave him an opportunity to ſignalize his Strengh and Activity; but it was his misfortune, in deſpite of himſelf, to be the object of the Counteſs of <hi>Angoulême<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> affection, who could not be inſenſible of the rare endowments that ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd him ſo worthy to be belov'd.</p>
                  <p>He was extreamly Beautiful, Diſcreet, Liberal and Valiant: nor did his frank humour, which came near that of the ancient Gauls, hinder him from being ſucceſsful in all manner of Intreagues. For thô he ſeem'd to be very open, yet he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd himſelf ſo well in all Negotiations, and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:53606:76"/> manag'd what he had to ſay with ſo much art, that he tyr'd the patience of the moſt refin'd Politicians. The ſweetneſs of his manners had acquir'd him the Friendſhip of the French, and the exact diſcipline which he kept among his Souldiers, produc'd him the eſteem of his own Enemies. It ſeem'd as if fortune had been una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably bound to follow him, becauſe that ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſince he bore Arms, the French had been always victorious wherever he was, and were vanquiſht whereever he was not. He was beholding on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his own deſerts for the dignity of Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and it may be ſaid, that he wanted nothing to accomplish him for the Hero of his Age, but a little more complacency for the perſon that lov'd him; or a little leſs reſentment of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury ſhe did him, when ſhe ſaw her ſelf ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>That haughty Princeſs made no oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, either to the growth or progreſs of her paſſion, whither ſhe were weary of living a Widow, or that ſhe was unwilling, in chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her condition, to be forc'd to leave <hi>France,</hi> where ſhe was aſſur'd of being in great credit, when her Son, the preſumptive Heir to the Crown, ſhould come to Reigne. But this Love was not reciprocal; whither it were that the Count of <hi>Montpenſier</hi> (for ſo was the Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble call'd at firſt) could not find in his Heart to marry a Woman that had a Son almoſt as old as himſelf; or whether it were, that he felt at the bottom of his Heart, a ſecret antipathy againſt her; or laſtly, that he fear'd to create a jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:53606:76"/> in him, whoſe Father in law he was to be Slander invented a fourth reaſon, which could not be true, becauſe that <hi>Montpenſier,</hi> had not as yet that ill opinion of the Counteſſes vitue, as he afterwards gave out, when ſhe had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd him of the principal function of his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. However, becauſe he had not a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue ſufficient to ſupport the luſtre of his Birth, and for that he was not of a humour to neglect any thing that he could lawfully come by, thô his probity and his continency were exemplary in the age wherein he liv'd, he correſponded with the Counteſs's affection in ſuch a manner, that ſhe ſhould not deſpair of rendring him ſenſible of her kindneſs, thô ſhe well perceiv'd him ſo far from being mov'd, that ſtill his Heart enjoy'd it's pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive liberty, nor to be enſlav'd by all her Charms.</p>
                  <p>With this deſign ſhe procur'd him the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Army in <hi>Guyenne,</hi> where he prov'd fortunate; and that of the Army in <hi>Italy</hi> which he refus'd, out of a ſecret miſdoubt of the little ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction he ſhould purchaſe by it. The mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune which always accompani'd the perſon who had that employment in his room, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted his judgment, and augmented his reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Counteſs of <hi>Angouleme,</hi> who ſaw that all Men applauded the care which he took of his Fortune, would have advanc'd him at the ſame time to the chief dignity of the Sword, had he not been conſtrain'd out of an unavoidable neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to eſpouſe thoſe intereſts, which were oppoſite to thoſe of his Benefactrice.</p>

                  <p>When the Count of <hi>Angoulême</hi> had marry'd Madam <hi>Claudia,</hi> the Counteſs his Mother began to take her place in the Council, and quarrel'd with the Dutcheſs of <hi>Beaujen,</hi> who till then had the chief management of affairs, and had acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her ſelf with extraordinary reputation.

She liv'd wrapt up with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual admiration of her own perſon; and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally ſcorn'd all other Ladies, whatever their rank or merits were. Nor was ſhe thus haughty without good grounds; for if there were any who equal'd her in Beauty, there were none that came near her for ſtrength and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of Wit.

She was alſo in Council when the Counteſs of <hi>Angoulême</hi> was admitted. <hi>Lewis</hi> XII. perceiving theſe two Princeſſes em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broil'd, and not being able to reconcile 'em, choſe rather to declare for the Mother of his Sod in law, then for his Siſter in Law. Which partial giving the precedency to the Counteſs of <hi>Angoulême,</hi> enrag'd the Dutcheſs of <hi>Beaujeu</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Imagination, and made her greedily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the opportunity of revenge, which offer'd it ſelf ſoon after. Her Husband di'd after he had reap'd the ſucceſſion of <hi>Buurbon,</hi> and left her but one Daughter nam'd <hi>Suſanna,</hi> who was afterwards the Original of the greateſt ſuit that ever <hi>France</hi> beheld for ſeveral Ages.</p>
                  <p>The Count of <hi>Montpenſier,</hi> who was become the eldeſt of the Houſe of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> pretended to the whole Eſtate, by virtue of a kind of Salic Law, as the Civilians term it, or rather by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of an ancient entail, renew'd from time to time, in both the Houſes of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted in the ſucceſſion to their Inheritances, the moſt remote Males, to the prejudice of the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Females. The Princeſs <hi>Suſanna,</hi> on the other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, grounded her right upon Common Law, and upon the Law of the Kingdom, which never excluded the Daughters of the moſt Illuſtrious Houſes, any more then the Daughters of the meaneſt Families, from the Inheritances of their Fathers, when they had no Brothers.</p>
                  <p>Now the only way to avoid the Suit, was to marry both Parties together, and the Dutcheſs of <hi>Beaujeu,</hi> who had diſcover'd the Counteſs of

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:53606:78"/> three days. His Majeſty, the Princes, the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Crown, and fifteen Biſhops Sign'd the Contract. But the Learned Lawyers who had drawn it up, forgot one Formality, of which the Chancellor <hi>du Prat</hi> made his advantage af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, convincing 'em of ignorance, in things which they had been ſtudying all their life time. The Dutcheſs of <hi>Beaujeu</hi> had given 'em leave to inſert the moſt favourable clauſes that could be for <hi>Monpenſier;</hi> and they thought they had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd his Intereſts, and ſtretch'd 'em as far as humane Prudence could have done, by making the marry'd Couple to exchange a mutual Deed of Gift to each other, of all their Lands, Rights and Pretenſions of what nature ſoever. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, they never minded that the Bride want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two or three Months of being of Age to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage her Eſtates; and that for a ſupply of that defect, as to what regarded the Civil executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; they were, as it behov'd,'em, to obtain a Sentence. This neglect was afterwards laid to their charge; but they excus'd themſelves, by ſaying, that they foreſaw the difficulty, but that they did not mind it, becauſe, that in Marriages contracted in <hi>France,</hi> the King's Preſence was a <hi>Salvo</hi> for the defects of all Conditions, as the Biſhops Preſence made good all Eccleſiaſtical Contracts.</p>

                        </gap>e</hi> was ſo much the more incens'd at theſe precipitated Nuptials, becauſe ſhe had ſo much the leſs time to croſs 'em: and ſhe made extraordinary efforts upon her ſelf to curh her Paſſion. But when ſhe
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:53606:79"/> thought ſhe had reaſon ſufficient to exchange her Love for Hatred, ſhe made choice of the Duke of <hi>Alençon,</hi> the Firſt Prince of the Blood, to be the inſtrument of her Revenge, believing him fit enough to ſecond her deſigns, becauſe he was particularly concern'd in the Affair; Mademoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle <hi>de Bourbon</hi> having been promis'd him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Monpenſier</hi> ſought her in Marriage. So that in point of Honour, with which the Court of <hi>France</hi> was at that time highly prepoſſeſs'd, he was to look upon <hi>Mompenſier,</hi> as one that had injur'd him in the moſt ſenſible part, by marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his affianc'd Lady, before he had ask'd whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he perſiſted in his deſign to eſpouſe her.</p>
                  <p>Thô theſe Reaſons, upon which the Counteſs built her hopes, had a foundation ſolid enough, yet they produc'd not that effect which ſhe expected. For beſides that the Duke of <hi>Alençon</hi> was not a perſon to engage in a Quarrel with <hi>Mompenſier,</hi> he was overjoy'd at the Match, which others thought it behov'd him to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at. In a word, after he had been deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Mademoiſelle <hi>de Bourbon,</hi> while ſhe was yet in her Cradle, he had been in love with Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle <hi>de Angouleme,</hi> the Counteſs's Daughter; thó he durſt not diſcover his Paſſion, for fear of provoking the Princes of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> who were extreamly nice in the punctilio's of Honour, and all were very ſtout. But the obſtacle being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd, he thought of ſeeking Mademoiſelle <hi>d' An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gouleme</hi> in marriage, when her Mother came and offer'd her to him. He accepted the proffer with joy, and promis'd whatever ſhe would have
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:53606:79"/> him to undertake to the prejudice of <hi>Monpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier:</hi> foreſeeing, that otherwiſe the Counteſs would never have made uſe of all the Authority which Nature and Law had given her over her Daughter, to perſwade her to a Match, againſt which, ſhe had always teſtify'd a reluctancy.</p>
                  <p>But after the Nuptials were over, the Duke of <hi>Alençon</hi> did not think it ſo proper to adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture his Perſon to content his Mother-in-law; and by good luck, which he ne'er expected, he was never ſollicited to accomplſh his promiſe. For the Counteſs, who had not well ſounded her Thoughts, when ſhe exacted that condition, was not long before ſhe perceiv'd, that ſhe had ſtill a kindneſs for <hi>Mompenſier,</hi> and that ſhe was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd in taking the rancour, under which it lay conceal'd, for the quenching of her Paſſion. Her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination was not exempt from the deſtiny com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to violent things, that redouble their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, proportionably to the reſiſtance which they meet with, ſeeing that ſhe lov'd <hi>Mompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier</hi> ſo much the more vehemently, by how much the leſs ſhe ſaw her ſelf in a condition to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd. So that ſhe obſerv'd no bounds in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Favours which lay in her power to procure him; and the firſt thing that ſhe deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for him of her Son, ſo ſoon as he came to the Crown, was the Conſtables Sword. The new King, altogether young, and without experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, made ſome ſcruple at it, and excus'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, by reaſon of the danger of committing all the Forces of the Kingdom into the hands of a Prince, who would ſoon be able to overturn it,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:53606:80"/> if his Ambition were anſwerable to his Birth and Deſerts. But the importunities of the Counteſs, and the aſcendant ſhe had over her Son, prevail'd above his Reaſon. And that which was moſt extravagant in this conjuncture, was, that the King ſuffer'd himſelf to be over-rul'd, when his Mother told him, that if he intended to merit not only the eſteem, but the admiration of his new Subjects, it was of great importance to him, to let 'em ſee, that he had neither the Puſilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity, nor the want of Courage of his four Predeceſſors, that durſt not truſt the Sword in the hands of the Princes of the Blood, for fear they ſhould afterwards ſtand in awe of 'em.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Monpenſier</hi> was no ſooner Conſtable, but he repented his being rais'd to that Dignity. His Wife was brought to bed of a Daughter; and the King did him the Honour to go to <hi>Chantilly,</hi> and be Godfather to his Child He was receiv'd by five hundred Gentlemen, holding by Fealty of the Houſe of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> clad in blew Velvet, with Gold Chains about their Necks conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of there rows, and rarely well hors'd. But this ſuperfluity was far exceeded by the Luxury of Feaſting, Tournaments, Balls and Masquerades; inſomuch, that the King return'd home ſtimulated with jealouſie, as if the Conſtable had pretended to diſpute the point of Magnificence with him.</p>
                  <p>This his Majeſties diſpleaſure broke forth in his march to <hi>Valenciennes,</hi> where the Duke of <hi>Alençon</hi> moſt earneſtly deſir'd his Mother-in-law, to procure the Command of the Vanguard for him, threat'ning to leave the Army if he did
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:53606:80"/> not obtain it: for, that being the Firſt Prince of the Blood, he could no longer obey a ſecond, without prejudice to his Quality, and redring himſelf contemptible to the <hi>French,</hi> of whom he might be one day Maſter before the Conſtable.</p>
                  <p>His reaſon was eaſily anſwer'd; but he was otherwiſe ſo unfortunate, that he might well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to have his real diſcontents appeas'd by a ſhadow of Honour that was not to laſt above four or five hours. His Wife, who was the moſt witty Woman of her Age, could not find in her heart to love him, as well for his ill Qualities, both of Body and Mind, as for that ſhe was conſtrain'd to marry him, after ſhe had been ſo ambitious as to pretend to the Prince of <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This ſame disagreement between Man and Wife, with which the Counteſs of <hi>Angoulême</hi> was well acquainted, moy'd her ſo much the more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe had been the occaſion of it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to make amends for the miſchief ſhe had done, as much as lay within her Power, ſhe begg'd of the King to let his Brother-in-law lead the Vanguard; which pretenſion of the Counteſs was grounded upon two Reaſons: One, becauſe the Conſtable would not be much concern'd at it, the King not being reſolv'd to give battel; and the Other, for that the Duke of <hi>Alençon,</hi> would have no more then the name of Chieftain, all Orders being to be given out by the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal de <hi>Chatillon,</hi> who ſerv'd under him with the Title of Lieutenant-General. But ſhe was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd in the firſt of her conjectures. For the Conſtable was as much concern'd, that they ſhould
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:53606:81"/> go about to ſet up another, to execute the moſt noble function of his Office, as if they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Sword from him: and then it was, that in the firſt tranſports of his reſentment, he let fall ſome words that reflected upon the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Counteſs of <hi>Angoulême.</hi> So many perſons heard 'em, that the Counteſs had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate notice of what was ſaid, and in regard her Continency was that of which ſhe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally boaſted, thô ſhe had been a Widow Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteen Years, ſhe could not bear that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whom ſhe lov'd above all the World, ſhould tax her of a criminal weakneſs, without ſeeking all the ways to hate him, that Reaſon and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge could infuſe into her. But whither it were that the affront ſhe had receiv'd was not ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, as her deſpite to ſee her Lover eſpouſe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſon: or whither it were, that all things which ought to have abated her Love, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to augment it, ſhe could not forbear loving the Conſtable, notwithſtanding his ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude; in like manner, as the ſeeing him mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd could not ſtifle her paſſion before; it ſo fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out in Love, as upon the Sea, that ſometimes we diſcern ſome rays of hope through the moſt gloomy and diſmal Tempeſts.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>May</hi> 1522. The Conſtables Wife dy'd in Childbed, leaving no Children behind her. Of which the Chancellor <hi>du Prat</hi> being inform'd, immediately went to the Counteſs of <hi>Angouleme</hi> with a Congratulation, that Heaven had now open'd her a way to enforce the Conſtable to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſe her Intereſt, ſince he refus'd to do it out
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:53606:81"/> of his own inclination. Then he told her, that ſhe was the next Heireſs to the Deceas'd, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the Conſtables Lady was the Daughter of <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> and the Counteſs was the Daughter of that Dukes Siſter. Whence he concluded, that he was in hopes to inveſt the ſucceſſion in her, by finding a flaw in the Conſtables Contract of Marriage, and the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient entail of the Houſe of <hi>Bourbon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That which induc'd the Chancellor to act in this manner, was not ſo much his deſire to pleaſe the Counteſs, thô he let ſlip no opportunity to do it, as to revenge himſelf upon the Conſtable for refuſing him the accommodation of a piece of Land, that lay near his Houſe of <hi>Verrieres,</hi> where he was born, in <hi>Auvergne.</hi> However the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs return'd him thanks, as much as if ſhe had been beholding to him for the felicity which ſhe expected all the remainder of her Life. The Chancellor undertook to furniſh her with ſuch Memoirs, as were requiſite for drawing up the proceſs. But the Counteſs before ſhe began, reſolv'd to make her laſt tryal upon the Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble's inclinations. And ſhe grounded her reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon this, that ſhe knew the Conſtable na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally lov'd Wealth, and a thrifty manner of expence; thô he were, magnificent upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that requir'd Pomp and ſplendor; and for that having marry'd to get an Eſtate, he might be induc'd to a ſecond Wedlock, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his Riches. To this purpoſe ſhe employd the Admiral <hi>de Bonnivet:</hi> But ſhe knew not that he was the moſt improper perſon ſhe could have
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:53606:82"/> made choice of, to carry on her deſign with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, tho' he had all the qualities requiſite, moſt delicately to negotiate an affair of that nature. There were therefore two reaſons, which ought to have oblig'd the Counteſs to have caſt her Eye upon ſome other perſon, had ſhe known ſo much. The one was, that he was in love with the Dutcheſs of <hi>Alençon,</hi> her Daughter, and that the virtue of that Princeſs, inſtead of van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhing his paſſion, by putting him quite out of all hope had caus'd him to commit thoſe follies, which in truth had no ſucceſs, but for which, neither the exceſs of his Love, nor the quality of a favourite, ought to have procur'd a pardon, had not the King been more kind to him, then he was juſt to his Siſter. So that the Kings indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to him had cover'd his paſſion, but had not extinguiſh'd it; and in regard he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly acquainted with the delicacy of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable, he well foreſaw, that if that Prince mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd the Counteſs, he would abſolutely forbid him the Dutcheſs of <hi>Alençon</hi>'s company. The other reaſon was, that <hi>Bonnivet,</hi> as he was the King's favourite, labour'd nothing more then the Conſtables diſgrace, that he might afterwards have the command of the Armies. So that twas no buſineſs of his to employ his cares in advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reputation of that Prince, and fixing him at Court, by aſſiſting him to Marry the King's Mother. But the Counteſs who was ignorant of all theſe circumſtances, open'd her Heart to <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivet,</hi> with an entire confidence, concealing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from him of her moſt ſecret thoughts.</p>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:53606:82"/>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs it was not the perfidiouſneſs of the Negotiator, that was the principal obſtacle to her deſign; for that another, more faithful, might have had no better ſucceſs. Beſides, that the Conſtable was ſo convinc'd of the Juſtice of his cauſe, that he did but laugh at whatever they ſaid. On the otherſide, the Queen had ſignifi'd to him her wiſhes, that he would Marry <hi>Renê</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> her Siſter. A Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs that was Miſtreſs of all the advantages of a ſublime Wit, for want of the graces of her body, and whoſe Eſtate was very large, in regard, a third part of the Free lands of the Houſe of <hi>Bretaigne,</hi> belong'd to her. The Conſtable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prepoſſeſs'd with thoſe hopes, ſent away <hi>Bonnivet</hi> with a flat denyal; ſo that the Counteſs of <hi>Ang<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Monthelon,</hi> a famous advocate, pleaded the Conſtables cauſe, with ſo much ſtrength of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that the King thought him worthy to be keeper of the Seals. <hi>Poyet</hi> ſpoke for the Countefs of <hi>Angoulême,</hi> and thô his Plea were neither ſo ſtrong nor ſo ſolid as the former, yet he dazl'd the greateſt part of the Judges; whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were propoſſeſs'd by the Chancellor, who had furniſh'd that Advocate with imaginary Nullities, or whither they were afraid of offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the head of the Law by not favouring the party for whom they ſaw him ſollicite with ſo much heat; or whither he had promis'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imburſe
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:53606:83"/>
'em the twelve hundred Crowns, which they had paid for their places.</p>
                  <p>Nor had they delay'd to pronounce ſentence, but at the ſollicitation of the Counteſs of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gouléme,</hi> who was willing to gain time, to make her laſt efforts upon the Conſtable, to perſwade him to marry her. She laid before him, by the friends ſhe had in Parliament, that his caſe was deplorable, and that he would make himſelf the pooreſt Prince in <hi>Europe.</hi> But thoſe two conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations did but augment his hatred of her, and perhaps it was but only the more to incenſe her, that he begg'd leave of the King to court <hi>Reué,</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> his Siſter in law.</p>
                  <p>The denyal which His Majeſty gave him, could not be more civil then it was; and it may be ſaid, that if <hi>Francis</hi> I. did ſecond his Mothers deſires, as unjuſt as they were, he did it in ſuch a manner, that nothing could be imputed to him; ſince it look't, as if the obſtacle proceeded whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the Princeſs <hi>René,</hi> who, as ſhe ſaid, could not find in her Heart to marry a Man, from whom they were going to take away his Eſtate. The Conſtable however diſſembl'd his reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and for ſome time was in ſuch a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary, as made the Counteſs believe, it would not be amiſs to give him another Attack. To that purpoſe ſhe ſent <hi>Bonnivet</hi> to build upon the Land, that went by his name, a ſtately Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, in a place ſo near to <hi>Chaſtelraut,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd to the Conſtable, that it commanded it. <hi>Bonnivet</hi> moſt joyfully obey'd, and the Conſtable afterwards acknowledg'd, that he never was ſo
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:53606:83"/> much concern'd at any thing, as at the boldneſs of that Favourite, who to brave him, had rais'd a kind of Cittadel upon a ſief that held of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. So that the Conſtable not being able to brook ſo many affronts, bent an Ear to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals which the Emperor made him by <hi>Adrian de Croy,</hi> Count of <hi>Rieux,</hi> firſt Gentleman of his Chamber, to embrace his party. That ſame Envoy croſs'd all <hi>France,</hi> in the diſguiſe of a Country-man, and arriv'd by Night at <hi>Chantilli,</hi> where he was lodg'd in an apartment adjoyning to the Conſtable's, and where he concluded the Treaty which afterwards prov'd ſo pernicious to <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But in regard, that <hi>Rieux</hi>'s power was only expreſs'd in general terms, and for that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable had reaſon to fear leſt the Emperor ſhould diſown his Miniſter, he ſent privately into <hi>Spain, La Mothe des Noyers,</hi> to procure a ratification of the Treaty from the Emperor. While the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable ſtaid for the return of his Agent, the Dew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ager of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> inſtigated by her hatred of the Counteſs oſ <hi>Angouléme,</hi> and her grief to ſee her Son in law, deſpoyl'd of his Fortune, came to him at <hi>Chantilli,</hi> and told him that ſhe was come to do him the Office of a real Mother, by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering to him an infallible way to recover the loſt condition of his affairs. Which Conſiſted in this, that <hi>Lewis</hi> XI. when he marry'd his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the youngeſt Son of the Duke of <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,</hi> had contracted by an inſtrument drawn up in due form, thô it lay conceal'd, that in caſe the Princeſs ſurviv'd her Brother in law and her
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:53606:84"/> Husband, and had no Children, ſhe ſhould inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit all their Lands. Whence it follow'd, that if the Counteſs of <hi>Angoulême</hi> agreed to that Act, ſhe muſt deprive her ſelf of the ſucceſſion to which ſhe pretended; or if ſhe diſputed it, ſhe would be no leſs diſappointed, ſince ſhe had no way to withſtand it, but by the entail of the Houſe of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> which would reſtore the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable to all his rights. The Dowager added, and made it appear by authentick papers, which ſhe deliver'd into the Conſtables hands, that ſhe had diſingag'd with her own Money the greateſt part of the Lands belonging to the Houſe of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> and that the reſt were ſo mortgag'd for her Dowry, and for performance of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, that thô the ſucceſſion were adjudg'd to the Counteſs of <hi>Angoulême,</hi> ſhe would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd to quit it, as being more burthenſome then profitable, by reaſon of the vaſt Sums which ſhe muſt pay before ſhe could enjoy it. The ſame Dowager after that, made a deed of gift to her Son in law of all her Eſtate, without any diſtinction or reſervation, inveſting him in all her rights.</p>
                  <p>The Conſtable was ſo much the more ſurpriz'd at the generoſity of his Mother in law, becauſe it was a thing that he ſo little expected. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he ſtill perſiſted in his deſign of performing his Treaty with the Emperor; whither it were that he foreſaw that his Adverſaries, ſhould they be depriv'd of the ſucceſſion by a contrary ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, would make uſe of the King's Authority, to preſerve themſelves in it: or that he thought
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:53606:84"/> himſelf ſo guilty, that he could not avoid Death if what he had concluded with the Count of <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eux,</hi> ſhould come to be known. After <hi>La Mothe</hi> had brought him back the ratification from <hi>Charles</hi> V. he hid it under ground in a little Box at the Root of a Tree, and ſent away the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of his Friends under pretence of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying the King beyond the <hi>Alps;</hi> but his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject did not ſucceed. For <hi>Matignon</hi> and <hi>d'Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gouges,</hi> going to confeſſion at <hi>Eaſter,</hi> diſcover'd to the Curat of their Country, that they had been tampring in a Conſpiracy againſt the King; the Curate enjoyn'd 'em to reveal it to the King, and to lead 'em the way; immediately took Horſe himſelf to inform <hi>Brez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Who giving themſelves over for loſt, took poſt, and overtaking the King at St. <hi>Pierre le Moutier,</hi> threw themſelves at his Feet, and obtain'd their pardon, by giving an exact Accompt upon Oath of the Conſtables Negotiation with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</p>
                  <p>The King was advis'd to arreſt the Conſtable, and confine him to a place of ſecurity, till his return; but he choſe rather to reclaim him by gentle means. To that purpoſe he gave him a viſit at <hi>Moulins,</hi> where he feign'd himſelf Sick, not ſo much out of a deſign to deceive His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, as to diſcover his real ſentiments; the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of his crime, having already ſhaken him to that degree, that he reſolv'd to perform nothing of the Treaty concluded with the Emperor, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the proceſs againſt him, might be ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:53606:85"/>
                  <p>'Tis preſum'd, the King would have given him that ſatisfaction, had he known his thoughts; but he was of opinion, he had gone farr enough in telling him, after he had commanded all the company to withdraw, that he was fully inform'd of his Negotiation with the Count of <hi>Rieux,</hi> and the reaſon of <hi>La Mothe des Noyers</hi>'s going into <hi>Spain;</hi> that they were two great crimes, however that he made no doubt, but that the Conſtable was inſtigated to do what he did, out of a deſpite of which he would repent ſo ſoon as he knew what he would do for him. The King added, by way of explanation, that he could not hinder his Mother from proſecuting her ſuit, but withall he offer'd him to give him all requiſite ſecurity, for the reſtitution of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhould be taken from him by the decree.</p>
                  <p>But this propoſal, as generous as it was, did not pleaſe the Conſtable for two reaſons. Firſt, becauſe it gave the Counteſs of <hi>Angoulême</hi> all the advantage ſhe could pretend to over him: and next, becauſe there was no judicial means by which he could be reſtor'd during the Life of that Princeſs, without offending her; and it was a baſe thing to be ſtill wiſhing for her Death; till when, he muſt remain depriv'd of all his Eſtate. Nevertheleſs he confeſs'd to the King what he was no longer in a condition to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and applauded the rare impartiality of his Majeſty, who rather choſe to preſerve a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Prince of the Blood, then to take the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of an inheritance, wherein himſelf was concern'd. With that the King believing he had
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:53606:85"/> won him, embrac'd him, ſwore to him, that he had bury'd his crime in Oblivion, deſir'd him to mind the recovery of his Health, and told him that he was going to <hi>Lyon,</hi> where his preſence was neceſſary to haſten away his Men, and that he would ſtay for him there. The Conſtable promis'd him to come in his Litter, and to that purpoſe was actually upon the Road. But at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſſe,</hi> he receiv'd advice, that the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> at the ſecret ſollicitations of the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, had order'd that all the Eſtate of the Houſe of <hi>Bourbon</hi> ſhould be ſequeſter'd, till the ſuit was fully decided.</p>
                  <p>The Conſtable being by this means diſabl'd to do any farther ſervice, feign'd that his diſtemper increas'd upon him, inſomuch that he could not endure the eaſy motion of the Litter, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing himſelf to <hi>Varry,</hi> who as he verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd, was left with him as a Spy, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of bearing him company, conjur'd him to go to the King, and let him know the weakneſs of his condition. <hi>Varry</hi> durſt not refuſe what he requeſted, for fear of rendering himſelf ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to the Conſtable; but ſo ſoon as he was out of ſight, the Conſtable return'd to <hi>Chantilli,</hi> from whence he diſpatch'd the Biſhop of <hi>Auntun</hi> to the Court, with Aſſurances, written and ſign'd with his own hand, that if they would can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel the decree of Parliament, and grant him a Pardon in due form, for what he had done againſt the State, he would for the future ſerve the King with the ſame fidelity, as he had done before the King's Mother threw him into deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair.
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:53606:86"/> But before <hi>Varry</hi> and the Biſhops were arriv'd at <hi>Lyon,</hi> the Counteſs being inform'd by her Emiſſaries about the Conſtable, that he was return'd to <hi>Chantilli,</hi> and miſtruſting that it was in order either to make his eſcape, or begin a Civil War, preſs'd ſo hard upon the King, that he ſent the Baſtard of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and Marſhal <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banes,</hi> with four hundred Lances, and four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Foot, to Beſiege him in <hi>Chantilli,</hi> and ſeize upon his perſon.</p>

                  <p>The Conſtable had taken the ſame Road, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compani'd by <hi>Pomperan,</hi> without any other precaution but what <hi>Arnauld</hi> gave him, which was to Travel with his Horſes ſho'd the wrong way. Which advice coſt <hi>Arnauld</hi> dear; for the Baſtard of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and <hi>Chabanes,</hi> who had in vain purſu'd the Conſtable, being inform'd of it, went to the Farrier, who ſho'd the Horſes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd him to confeſs the truth, rode away to <hi>Arnauld</hi>'s Houſe, becauſe he had followed the Conſtable, and plunder'd it. In the mean time, the Conſtable got without any ſtop to <hi>Dole,</hi> from whence he paſs'd into <hi>Italy,</hi> and viſited the Marquis of <hi>Mantua.</hi> I ſhall not here repeat the unhappy conſequences of his revolt, which are more proper for a general Hiſtory, then the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of the Counteſs of <hi>Angoulême.</hi> Who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhe had occaſion'd the taking of her Son Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, out of the jealouſy of her Ambition, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed not a little to the Tragical end of his Miſtreſs.</p>
                  <p>The Counteſs of <hi>Chaſteau-Brian,</hi> finding her ſelf expos'd to the hatred of that Princeſs, who was left Rege<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="169" facs="tcp:53606:87"/> 
                     <hi>Navarr.</hi> So that finding there was no retiring for her among her own Friends, ſhe was forc'd to return home to <hi>Chaſteau-Brian.</hi> Her Husband receiv'd her, thô after a very odd manner; yet ſo as to put her in hopes that ſhe might appeaſe him in time.</p>
                  <p>He refus'd to ſee her, and ſhut her up in a Chamber, which ſeem'd to be deſign'd for Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, as being hung all with Mourning. He gave his Daughter, by this time Seventeen Years of Age, leave to Eat with her; nor could he forbear looking upon her ſomtimes after Dinner, from a place where ſhe could not ſee him; and comparing the growing Beauty of the one, with that of the other, which was in the height of its perfection. This uſage laſted not above ſix Weeks, becauſe the Daughter liv'd no longer: and now the Count, not having any longer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Eyes, the only beloved object that Day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begg'd the t'others Pardon, thought of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more but his Revenge. To which purpoſe, he enter'd his Wives Chamber with Six Men in diſguiſe, and two Chirurgeons, who open'd the Veins in her Feet and Legs, and ſo left her to Bleed to Death. The King upon his return was all for making examples of the guilty, but a new Amour ſoon blotted out the remembrance of the firſt.</p>
                  <p>Nor was the Count forgetful of his own ſafety in the exceſſes to which his jealouſy had tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported him: for he prevented the proſecutions of juſtice, by a voluntary exile, and liv'd in For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Countries ſo long as the Houſe of <hi>Foix</hi> was
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:53606:88"/> in a condition to proſecute him. At length he addreſs'd himſelf to the Conſtable <hi>Montmorency,</hi> who was become a greater Favourite then before, by the Death of <hi>Bonnivet,</hi> and <hi>Monchenu,</hi> who ſhar'd with him in the King's good will. The Count offer'd him a deed of gift of his Royalty, provided he could get him out of his Troubles, and <hi>Montmorency</hi> choſe rather to purchaſe <hi>Chaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>au-Brian</hi> by that means, then by a Confiſcation, which would have engag'd him in perpetual quarrels, which the Houſe of <hi>Laval,</hi> from whence the Count was decended. Some Critiques have pretended, that <hi>M. de Varillas,</hi> from whom I drew theſe Memoirs, was ill inform'd; and that the Counteſs of <hi>Chaſteau-Brian</hi> was reconcil'd to her Husband, and that ſhe did not Die till ten Years after the King's return. But theſe objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are ſo well anſwer'd, that I am convinc'd of the Counteſs's tragical end; ſo that I made no ſcruple to follow that famous Hiſtorian, word for word.</p>
                  <p>No ſooner was <hi>Francis</hi> I. deliver'd out of the hands of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> bat he re-enter'd into a new impriſonment; which thô more eaſie and pleaſant, yet was do leſs dangerous. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs of <hi>Angoulême</hi> going to meet him as far as <hi>Mont de Marſan,</hi> carry'd along with her, the young <hi>Ann de Piſſeleu,</hi> who was call'd Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle <hi>de Hellé,</hi> who was entertain'd as a Maid of Honour, into the Houſhold of that Princeſs. The King found her ſo amiable, that he was not able to defend his liberty againſt her Charms. He marry'd her in a ſhort time to the Duke <hi>d' Eſtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes,</hi>
                     <pb n="171" facs="tcp:53606:88"/> who conniv'd at her conduct; neither willing to approve it, for fear of injuring his Reputation; nor to condemn her, leſt he ſhould bring himſelf into trouble. The Dutcheſs find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſelf at liberty to make the beſt of her good fortune to pleaſe the King, ne'er minded any longer the avoiding any occaſion that might advance her proſperity. She had got ſo much experience at Court, as to know that the moſt dangerous Rock that the King's Miſtreſſes could hazard their Fortune againſt, was to quarrel with the Favourites or Miniſters, who having often the Prince's Ear, may take the advantage of certain moments of diſguſt, and petty fallings out between Lovers, to exaſperate 'em, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade 'em to an abſolute Rupture. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, made her reſolve to unite Intereſts with the Conſtable <hi>Montmorency,</hi> the Admiral <hi>Chabot,</hi> and the Chancellor <hi>du Prat,</hi> who, by the Authority of their Imployments, and by the King's Indulgence, had got poſſeſſion of the prime Miniſtry. Thoſe three Officers, very obligingly correſponded with the firſt move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which the Ducheſs made toward the Quadruple League; well knowing, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Greatneſs of their Credit, yet it might be ſhaken, if the King's Miſtreſs under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood how to make the beſt of thoſe Favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Minutes, when a Lover can deny nothing to the perſon upon whom he doats.</p>
                  <p>This correſpondence between theſe four Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons prov'd ſucceſsful, during the remainder of time that the Chancellor liv'd; becauſe that
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:53606:89"/> cunning Miniſter, by his experience and diligence, provided ſo well for all the exigencies of the State, that the Favourites had no other care upon 'em, but to divertiſe their Maſter. But after his death, the Council wanting a Director, the Conſtable and the Admiral, who took no heed to inſtruct themſelves, appear'd ſuch No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices in the Government, that the King was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd to call up the Preſident <hi>Poyet.</hi> He was one of the moſt able Magiſtrates in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and his Capacity was equally the ſame, to manage, as well great as ſmall Affairs, only his Genius led him rather to put things into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, then bring 'em to a final end. So ſoon as he had taken his place in the Council, he propos'd the removal of the two Favourites, that only ſerv'd to fill up the number; becauſe the haughtineſs of the firſt was become inſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to him, and he fear'd the reſentment of the ſecond, by reaſon of a Suit of great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, wherein he had caus'd him to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown. Fortune ſeem'd to favour his Deſigns; for the King diſguſted at the ill ſucceſs of his Enterprizes, had it put into his Head, that he might juſtify his ill Conduct to poſterity, if he laid the blame of it upon his Favourites, and that their downfal would render 'em guilty of all the falſe ſteps which he had trode in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick management of Affairs. The Admiral was the firſt that was to feel the effects of his ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, thô he were in friendſhip vvith the Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs of <hi>Eſtampes.</hi> They who did not dive into the King's more ſecret Thoughts, aſcrib'd the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:53606:89"/> Fall of <hi>Chabot</hi> to his imprudence, which had hinder'd his Majeſty from utterly deſpoiling the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> of his Territories. The King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted <hi>Poyet,</hi> whom he had inveſted in the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Chancellor, with his Indignation againſt the Admiral, and conſulted with him the beſt way to proceed againſt him, in due form of Law. The Chancellor was overjoy'd to find the King ſo well diſpos'd to favour his deſigns, and made him thoſe Propoſals that gave him great ſatisfaction. Nevertheleſs, becauſe he ſtood in awe of the Dutcheſs <hi>d' Eſtampes</hi>'s Anger, whoſe Power he well knew, he ſought the Protection of <hi>Diana</hi> of <hi>Poictiers,</hi> Wife to the Seneſchal of <hi>Normandy,</hi> and the Dauphin's Miſtreſs.</p>
                  <p>That Lady was the Daughter of <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Poicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> Lord of <hi>St. Valliere,</hi> who had preferr'd her very young to the Counteſs of <hi>Angouléme:</hi> after which, ſhe was advanc'd to the ſervice of Queen <hi>Claudia,</hi> as one of her Maids of Honour. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was <hi>St. Valliere</hi> deceiv'd in his deſign of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſome Protection at Court, through the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his Daughter's Charms: for it may be ſaid, that ſhe ſav'd his Life by the ſecret Engines that ſhe ſet at work. <hi>St. Vallier</hi> had had a hand in the revolt of the Conſtable of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> and the misfortune to be apprehended. For which he had been Arraign'd, and was condemn'd to loſe his Head. <hi>Diana</hi> was ſo aſtoniſh'd when ſhe heard the news, that ſhe thought her ſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to do her utmoſt to ſave her Father from ſuch a threatning danger. Thereupon, ſhe went and threw her ſelf at the King's Feet, all in Tears,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:53606:90"/> and begg'd pardon for him, to whom ſhe was beholding for her Life. And ſhe appear'd to the King in that deplorable condition, ſo amiable, and ſo charming, that ſhe obtain'd whatever ſhe deſir'd, and infus'd Love into his Heart, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the mask of Pity. She preſerv'd her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt till the King's fatal march into <hi>Italy,</hi> and he endeavour'd to conceal his Infidelity from the Counteſs of <hi>Chateau-Brian,</hi> for whom he had always a great reſpect. We have already ſaid, that at his return, he was ſo enamour'd of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demoiſelle <hi>d' Helle,</hi> that ſhe wholly poſſeſs'd his Heart, and render'd him inſenſible to all the other Ladies of the Court; <hi>Diana,</hi> who had been marry'd a long time before to <hi>Lewis de Brezé,</hi> Seneſchal of <hi>Normandy,</hi> endeavour'd to comfort her ſelf for that ſame change of the King's Affection, with the marks of kindneſs which the Dauphin ſhew'd her, whoſe Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhe underſtood ſo well how to manage, that he continu'd faithful to her till death. But thô ſhe had reaſon enough to be ſatisfy'd with this victory, yet ſhe could never pardon Madam <hi>d' Eſtampes</hi> for ſtealing the King's Heart from her, and conceiv'd ſuch a mortal hatred againſt her, that ſhe never fail'd of giving the proofs of it upon all occaſions that preſented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Poyet,</hi> who was acquainted with all theſe things, believ'd that he could not make choice of a better ſupport; and in regard ſhe was no leſs glad to have the Head of the Law on her ſide, the League was ſoon made. The Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:53606:90"/> after he had taken theſe Precautions, gave the King ſuch poſitive aſſurances of ruining the Admiral in due form of Law, that he caus'd him to be arreſted, and ſent him to <hi>Bois de Vincenues:</hi> and <hi>Poyet</hi> immiediately drew up the Interrogatories, upon which he was to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd. Nor was there any need of any great ſubtilty in the matter, for that the Admiral an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd after ſuch a manner, as did himſelf the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt injury. And in regard, he made his defence more like a brave Soldier, then a cunning Lawyer, he confeſs'd the very things that condemn'd him, believing 'em to be ſervice able to his juſtification. Nor did he ſpeak exactly the language of the Seamen, which was only underſtood by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners at that time; nor was he ſufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of the difference between the Priviledges belonging to the Admiral, and thoſe which the Laws reſerv'd to the King. The Chancellor therefore, that he might make the beſt of theſe three defects, perſwaded the King to chuſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners out of all the Parlaments of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to decide the Proceſs, and to take the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular cognizance of it from the Parlament of <hi>Paris,</hi> the natural judge of Affairs of the Crown, as the Admiral's buſineſs was.</p>
                  <p>They who were made choice of, were ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to the Chancellor, that there was no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion to be made, but they would regulate their Suffrages according to the Chancellor's Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; and had he been contented with that precaution, the Admiral would have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd, and no body ſhould have known who
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:53606:91"/> had been the moſt active Agent in his ruin. But nothing would ſerve the Chancellor, but to put himſelf at the head of the Commiſſioners; of which the Admiral had no ſooner knowledge, but excepted againſt him. It is hardly to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd that <hi>Poyet</hi> ſhould be ignorant that his Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity exempted him, as well from the Exception, as from the Reproaches that attended it. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, if we conſider his Conduct at that time, it lookt as if he underſtood not the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge that belong'd to his Office. To ward off this blow, which broke all his meaſures, he had recourſe to an Artifice, the malignity of which had never been practis'd in a Court, where there was ſome decorum ſtill obſerv'd in matter of Probitie. He was aſſur'd that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment of the Admiral had allarm'd the Dutcheſs and the Conſtable, who could not chuſe but be apprehenſive of the ſame uſage in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time, and that the conſideration of their own, rather then of the danger of their Friend, would incite 'em to leave nothing omitted which they deem'd requiſite to ſave his Life. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he order'd his Agents neatly to inſinuate it into their Heads, that it was no leſs his intereſt then theirs, to preſerve the Admiral, and that the change which had happen'd in the Council, threaten'd with the ſame diſgrace, all thoſe who had the Honour to be admitted into it. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, that the miſchief was not ſo great as it might be imagin'd to be, ſince the Chancellour was not excluded from the number of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners; that be had taken all the precautions
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:53606:91"/> which the Law had taught him, to prevent the Judgment from extending it ſelf either to natural or civil Death; but that he had underſtood with equal ſentiments of Vexation and pity, that the Admiral had not a worſe Enemy then his own ſelf: that of neceſſity it muſt be concluded, that either the fear of Death had depriv'd him of his judgment, or that the Councel aſſign'd him of were falſe to him, ſince he talk'd of refuſing the Head of the Law, and the only Friend that he had remaining among the Judges: that his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for excepting againſt him, grounded upon the loſs of his Suit, was ridiculous; in regard that beſides that the buſineſs in controverſy, was but a trifle; 'twas ſo long while ago, and there had been ſuch a change in the face of affairs ſince that, that the Admiral had no more reaſon to bear it in remembrance, then two grave Old Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen might have to miſtruſt one of another, becauſe, that in their Infancy they had quarrel'd about a Pin. This compariſon as mean as it was, made 'em ſo clearly apprehenſive of the difference between <hi>Poyet,</hi> a Counſellor in Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament only, and the ſame <hi>Poyet,</hi> a Chancellor and Miniſter of State, that the Dutcheſs and the Conſtable ſuffer'd themſelves to be ſurpriz'd, They were dazled with the falſe hopes which the Chancellor gave 'em, and communicated their miſtake to the Admiral, while they thought to un-hood wink his Eyes. So that they oblig'd him to deſiſt from his exception, and the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor by that means being become Maſter of the proceſs, by the conſent of the parties, promis'd
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:53606:92"/> to himſelf that he ſhould be able to manage it as the King pleas'd.</p>
                  <p>A Man would have thought there was nothing now that could have prevented the ruin of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot,</hi> after his Friends had ſo ſtupidly fallen into the ſnare that was laid for 'em, when the King unwilling to take away the life of a favourite, for a crime which he did not believe him guilty of, ſignifi'd to the Chancellor, that he would be content with a decree that might only puniſh the Admiral with the loſs of all that he had acquir'd. The ſentence then was pronounc'd with all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality that could be, and the King after he had made uſe of <hi>Poyets</hi> Miniſtry, to ſhew a great example of ſeverity, was no leſs deſirous imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after, of his own free will, and without communicating his thoughts to any body, to make manifeſt as great an example of his clemency: doubtleſs that he might improve the value of his Mercy, and cauſe the Dutcheſs to ſet a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er price upon the favour which he was reſolv'd to do at her requeſt. For he did not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the Admiral to his employment, and his Government of <hi>Poitou,</hi> but he order'd the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to be review'd, and a Declaration to be made by way of Interpretation of the Edict, that that ſame Officer of the Crown had neither been convicted of Treaſon nor Treachery.</p>
                  <p>After the Reſtoration of the Admiral, the Triumvirate recover'd it's former Authority, and it was thought that nothing could have bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Union between thoſe three Perſons, when the Conſtable, through his own imprudence
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:53606:92"/> drew upon himſelf, a misfortune from which he could never retreive him ſelf, during the Reign, of <hi>Francis</hi> I. and if he return'd to Court in the following Reign, 'twas no longer to ſecond the deſigns of the Dutcheſs's <hi>d'Eſtampes;</hi> for he took part with her Rivaleſs, and marry'd his Son to the Daughter of that Lady, the Widow of <hi>Horatio Farneſe,</hi> of which more in due place.</p>
                  <p>The Emperor had deſir'd of the King of <hi>France,</hi> free paſſage through his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1539</label> to puniſh the <hi>Gaulois,</hi> who were revolted againſt him, and offr'd the inveſtiture of the Dutchy of <hi>Milan</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Orleance,</hi> his ſecond Son. The Conſtable was for giving the Emperor leave to croſs the Kingdom, provided that before he enter'd, he confirm'd in writing the promiſe which the Commiſſioners had made, and that to that effect, ſome perſon of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity might be ſent to meet his Imperial Majeſty under pretence of doing him the more Honour, but indeed, to get that Writing from him in due form. The Cardinal of <hi>Tournon</hi> was of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary opinion, but tho ſupported with reaſons ſo ſolid, that they ſeem'd to be beyond all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, yet it was not follow'd. And as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable in ſpeaking, had more regard to the Idea that prepoſſeſs'd him, then to the Truth, ſo did the King alſo give his judgment, rather according to his own inclination, which had turn'd his Eyes toward <hi>Milan,</hi> then with a proſpect of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms welfare.</p>
                  <p>Not was the Conſtable contented to have turn'd the balance on his ſide, his vanity was
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:53606:93"/> ſuch, that nothing would ſerve him, but to be made choice of for the perſon, that was to go and meet the Emperor, and receive him upon the <hi>Frontiers;</hi> nor would the vain glory of ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable a Commiſſion, let him ſee the dangers that attended it. He met the Emperor beyond the River of <hi>Bidaſſoa,</hi> and preſs'd him accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Inſtructions, to grant before hand the inveſtiture of the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> who, together with the Dauphin, ſtay'd for his Imperial Majeſty on the otherſide of the River.</p>
                  <p>The Emperor who had his anſwer ready, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs'd the Conſtable after an extraordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and declar'd to him, that he would wholly refer it to him, and rely upon what he ſhould adviſe him to do. Which done, he entruſted him with a Counterſeit ſecret, feigning to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to him the bottom of his Heart, and leſt nothing omitted to convince the Conſtable that he was reſolv'd at laſt to ſatisfy the King. He added that all the ſcruple lay in the time, and that he did not ſtand ſo much upon preſerving his own Reputation, as the credit of <hi>Francis</hi> I. for that as his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty chiefly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to appear generous, it would be the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt injury that could be done him in the World, ſhould his Honour be Ecclips'd, by giving all <hi>Europe</hi> a pretence to preſume that he had not permitted, but ſold the Emperor a paſſage. Which they would not fail to give out, if the inveſtiture ſhould be given before the paſſage was granted. Whereas if the leave were permitted
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:53606:93"/> nobly and without conditions, he gave his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial word, that he would cauſe the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the inveſtiture to be diſpatch'd in the firſt City of the <hi>Low-Countries;</hi> with a preamble no leſs to the Honour of his Brother-in-Law, then his own: becauſe it ſhould contain, that the kind entertainment that he had given him in <hi>France,</hi> and the Friendſhip that he had-ſhewn him, had engag'd him to acknowledge ſuch ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal favours by a preſent no leſs magnificent then was the Dutchy of <hi>Milan-</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Emperor, upon the ſcore of his promiſe, was regal'd from <hi>Bayonne,</hi> to <hi>Chatelraut,</hi> whither the King was advanc'd to receive him; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs when <hi>Francis</hi> I. underſtood the ſnare, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which the Conſtable was fallen, he was diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfi'd with his Negotiation, and, was juſt upon the point of purſuing the Counſel that had been given him, to ſeize upon the Emperors perſon, under plauſible pretences, till he had put the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> in full poſſeſſion of the Dutchy of <hi>Milan. Le Peloux,</hi> a French Gentleman, who had put himſelf into the Emperors Service, gave him notice of it; who judging the danger ſo much the more inevitable, by how much People are apt to believe as ſoon what they fear, as what they wiſh for and deſire, he revolv'd in his mind, all the expedients that the moſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd ſubtil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>y could furniſh him withal, and and found none better, then that of a ſurprizing liberality. The Lady whom he feard moſt, was the Dutcheſs <hi>d'Eſtampes,</hi> who ſolely govern'd the King, and had quitted her aſſociation with
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:53606:94"/> the Conſtable ever ſince the underſtood that he held correſpondence with the Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchal's Wife, to the end he might have the protection of a perſon near the Dauphin, when he came to the Crown. Theſe two Ladies had had a terrible falling out, during <hi>Montmorenci</hi>'s journey, and upon his return he was oblig'd to chooſe his ſide in the quarrel. The occaſion of the quarrel was, that the Dutcheſs ſhould ſay, that ſhe was born the ſame Day that the Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchal's Wife was marry'd. Which villanous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of Old Age, ſo hainouſly offended the perſon whom it concern'd, that it was impoſſible to pacify her. The Conſtable after he had in vain employ'd all his credit, declar'd for the ſhe Seneſchal: whither it were, that he prefer'd the riſing before the Setting-Sun, or that he thought his Fortune ſo firmly ſettl'd with the King, that nothing could ſhake it. But his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight was not true on bothſides, for that in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking the Dutcheſs he incens'd a revengeful Woman, who had too much Wit to omit the firſt opportunity ſhe met with, to haſten his ruin. In a word, ſhe had approv'd the advice which the Cardinal of <hi>Tournon</hi> gave, and peal'd continually in the King's Ears, that His Majeſty would become the object of publick raillery, if he ſuffer'd himſelf to be ſo cheated and deluded. Whither the Emperor were inform'd or no, of theſe particulars, is not ſo certainly known, but he acted after ſuch a manner, as if he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly underſtood 'em. One Day that he was waſhing his hands with the King before Dinner,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:53606:94"/> and that the Dutcheſs prereated 'em the Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, he let fall a Jewel enrich'd with a Diamond of great value: preſently the Dutcheſs took it up, and would have return'd it, but the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror told her with a graceful and pleaſant aſpect, which he could put on when he pleas'd, that he never envy'd the preſent that Fortune had made to ſo charming a perſon; that the Ring belong'd to her by an inviolable Law, of the Empire, which was ſo far from permitting the Emperors to take back again what had fallen from their hands, how great ſo e'er the value of it were, that he ordain'd it to remain with the perſon, that ſhould find it, as a teſtimony of the Adventure. 'Twas no difficult thing to find out the place from whence this Law was taken, nor to bring examples to juſtify that it had been in uſe. The Dutcheſs therefore made uſe of all her alluring language to perſwade the Emperor to receive the Jewel back again, and the King preſs'd him withal the civility that could be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd. But the Emperor, who had too well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun his artifice to leave it off imperfect, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted ſo obſtinately in his reſolution that the Jewel ſhould remain with the Dutcheſs, that the King was conſtrain'd to let her keep it.</p>
                  <p>The effect of this Jewel was, that the Dutcheſs, who wanted no Wit, reflecting upon the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors courtſhip, and upon his ſuttlety, to make her accept of a magnificent preſent at the only conjuncture, wherein the King could conſent to her acceptance of it, found her ſelf engag'd to defer her revenge upon the Conſtable, for fear
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:53606:95"/> leaſt the diſgrace of that Favourite, ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon a Prince ſo liberal as the Emperor. The Court remov'd afterwards to <hi>Paris,</hi> where his Imperial Majeſty ſtaid only ſo long as was neceſſary to give the King ſome time to empty his Coffers by a ſuperſluous magnificence. From thence he went to <hi>Chantilli,</hi> where the Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble treated him in his turn. The King alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted the Emperor as far as <hi>St. Quentin,</hi> and commanded the Dauphin and the Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans</hi> to accompany him as far as <hi>Valenciennes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Man would hardly believe the careſſes which the Emperor beſtow'd upon the Youngeſt of thoſe two Princes, under pretence of his being charm'd with his pleaſant humour. He treated him like one that was to be his Son-in-Law, and put him in hopes that the fief of <hi>Milan</hi> was not the only favour which he was to expect. After the Emperor was got within his own territories, the Conſtable and the Biſhop of <hi>Vabres,</hi> the French Ambaſſador, demanded Audience, and preſt him to perform his promiſe. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror durſt not disguſt 'em at firſt, becauſe the King might ſuccor the Inhabitants of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> and therefore he only return'd 'em for anſwer, that the King of the Romans his Brother, was upon the road for <hi>Flanders,</hi> and that it was neceſſary to ſtay for his arrival, to the end there might remain no diſpute about the inveſtiture, which he had promis'd without acquainting him who was to ſucceed in the Empire, with his deſign. The Conſtable upon that, return'd to the King his Maſter, but the Biſhop of <hi>Vabres</hi> who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ow'd
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:53606:95"/> the Emperor, continu'd his importunities ſo vigorouſly, that he conſtrain'd him at laſt to pull off his Maske, and to diſown all that he had ſaid to the Conſtable.</p>
                  <p>The King, ſo much the more nettl'd at this piece of Infidelity, by how much it equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd both his Honour and his Intereſts, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd his fault in not demanding a writing, from the Emperor: and becauſe there is nothing ſo uſual, as for Princes to lay the blame of their own mis-failings upon others, when they have the leaſt pretence; he complain'd of his being deceiv'd, for no other reaſon but that he might have an occaſion to puniſh the Conſtable, whom he upbraided with all the faults he had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; he confin'd him to his Houſe of <hi>Chentilly;</hi> and people made no queſtion but the Dutcheſs <hi>d'Eſtampes</hi> was the cauſe of his Diſgrace. And the proof of what was alledg'd was grounded upon this, that the Dauphin, after he had made uſe of all his power to ſupport his Goſſip, for ſo he call'd the Conſtable, not only could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with the King, but drew upon himſelf ſevere Reprimands, which he thought he no way de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd.</p>

Nor did ſhe delay it any longer then the Evening of the ſame day, at what time
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:53606:96"/> ſhe preſented <hi>la Renaudie,</hi> holding the Letters in his hand, to the King, as he roſe from the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. That Gentleman, naturally eloquent, as he made it afterwards appear in the conſpiracy of <hi>Amboiſe,</hi> aggravated the importance of the words which the Chancellor had alter'd, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to exaſperate the King againſt him, by reaſon of that oppoſition which he adventur'd to make aginſt his abſolute Power. The King, who for a long time had had a deſire to diſgrace the Chancellor, could not have met with a more plauſible pretence. He was hated by all the Court and it was well known that no body would be ſorry for him nevertheleſs, for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Reaſons his downfal was delaid. The King only order'd <hi>La Renaudie</hi> to carry back the Letters to the Chancellor, and to command him peremptorily in his Name, to diſpatch 'em with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any qualifications. <hi>La Renaudie</hi> return'd to <hi>Poyet,</hi> and deliver'd his Meſſage with an arrogant Tone, in the preſence of the Queen of <hi>Navarr,</hi> who at the ſame time ſolicited for a Servant of hers, who was convicted for having ſtoll'n a wealthy Heireſs. The Chancellor was too haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, patiently to endure, that a Country Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman ſhould put a kind of affront upon him in his own Houſe, and before a Princeſs, whoſe Eſteem it concern'd him to preſerve. But in regard he durſt not refuſe to obey the ſecond Order, not to give the bearer ill language, he took the Letters from <hi>Renaudie,</hi> and ſhewing 'em to the Queen of <hi>Navarr,</hi> See here, Madame, ſaid he, what the Ladies do at the Court, they are
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:53606:97"/> not contented to exerciſe their Empire, but they undertake to violate the Laws, and to inſtruct the Magiſtrates, the moſt accompliſh'd in the exerciſe of their Offices. Now thô the Chancellor aim'd in his Diſcourſe, at no body but the Dutcheſs, yet it happen'd unluckily for him, that the Queen of <hi>Navarr</hi> thought her ſelf nipp'd by the ſeverity of his ſhort Satyr, by reaſon that the terms were equivocal, and might as well be apply'd to her ſollicitations, in behalfe of her Servant, as to the conſtraint that was put upon him to Seal <hi>la Renaudie</hi>'s Letters. However, ſhe did not diſcover all her Reſentment, for fear of quarrelling with one of the King her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Officers, only made him anſwer, That ſhe was too much concern'd in the misfortune of which he complain'd, to procure him any repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, ſince ſhe could not right her ſelf. But ſhe was no ſooner gone out of the Chancellor's Houſe, but ſhe went to the Dutcheſs, and gave her an account of the chafe that <hi>Poyet</hi> was in; nor did ſhe leave her, till they had concerted both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, which way to put him quite out of the King's Favour. 'Twas no difficult thing for thoſe two Ladies, who had ſhar'd between 'em, the Love and Friendſhip of that Prince, to make him conſent to abandon a Man, whom he had a deſign already to be rid of; immediately there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Majeſty ſent for the Seals, which he gave to <hi>Francis de Manthelon,</hi> Preſident of the Parliament, no leſs famous for his Integrity, then for his vigorous Defence of the Conſtable of <hi>Bourbon</hi>'s Cauſe, when he was an Advocate. Nor

They had ſufficiently penetrated into his Intreagues, to be convinc'd, that if he had his liberty, he would infallibly refix himſelf at Court; or if that way fail'd him, ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture might happen, that ſome exigency of Affairs might conſtrain the King to ſend for him to come and take his place in Council. It behov'd 'em then to diſable him from waiting for ſuch an opportunity; and the two Ladies to bring about their deſign, form'd a Faction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, conſiſting of the Principal Perſons of the Court, not excepting Queen <hi>Eleonor,</hi> who made one, thô ſhe had reſolv'd, not to meddle with any thing, more eſpecially, when there was a War in agitation againſt the Emperor her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. People were a long time ſearching after the reaſon of this change in the Queens Mind, and the ſpeculative Perſons imagin'd they had made the diſcovery, which was this; She had liv'd in <hi>France</hi> as it were in exile, and ſhe had little acqaintance in the Country: She had ſuffer'd much from the Dutcheſs <hi>d' Eſtampes,</hi> who left her no ſhare in the King's Affection; and as an accumulation to her diſcontent, ſhe
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:53606:98"/> was neither able to revenge her ſelf, nor to better her own condition. Nor had her miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune mov'd any of the Courtiers, but only the Conſtable <hi>Montmorency,</hi> who had aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her out of Love, as her Enemies reported, or out of pity, which was moſt probable. She knew that the Chancellor <hi>Poyet</hi> had contributed to the Chancellors diſgrace; and her ſtomaching of that, was ſufficient to oblige her to ſide with a Party, which gave her the opportunity to be reveng'd of the one, and to contribute to the reſtauration of the other.</p>
                  <p>The Dauphin appear'd at the Head of the Chancellor's Enemies, that he might give <hi>Montmorency,</hi> in his retirement to <hi>Chantilly,</hi> the conſolation to underſtand, that he who had been the inſtrument to remove him from the Court, was himſelf baniſht from thence without any hopes of returning thither again. The King of <hi>Navarr</hi> joyn'd meerly, out of complacence to his Wife: The Count of <hi>St. Paul,</hi> out of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain antipathy, which ſometimes happens between the Princes of the Blood and the Chief Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters: The Admiral <hi>Chabot,</hi> that he might have the ſatisfaction of ſeeing his Enemy fall into the ſnare which he had laid for him: <hi>Mompezat,</hi> in hatred of the Counterpoiſe which the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor gave to his Favour: And the Cardinal of <hi>Tournon,</hi> and Marſhal <hi>d' Annhauit,</hi> that they might remain alone in the Council of State. All theſe Perſons had made ſo powerful a combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the King was unable to withſtand it any longer. They peal'd in his Ears, how dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:53606:98"/> a thing it was to let a Lion live in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to hurt him, after he had once provok'd him. That the Chancellor had in his hands all the Deeds and Inſtruments of the Crown, and that his Majeſty had truſted him with his moſt important Secrets, which <hi>Poyet</hi> might render uſeleſs, by revealing 'em to the Emperor, and by his perfidiouſneſs, procure himſelf a publick Settlement as conſiderable in <hi>Spain,</hi> as he loſt in <hi>France.</hi> Whence they concluded, that there was a neceſſity of confining him to a place of ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and to watch him ſo narrowly, that it, might not be in his power to do any miſchief, thô he ſhould deſign it.</p>
                  <p>The King rather weari'd with the frequent repetition of theſe Reaſons, then convinc'd by the ſtrength of 'em, gave order, at his going to Bed to <hi>Lewis de Nevers,</hi> to Arreſt the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, and carry him to the Tower of <hi>Bourges. Nevers</hi> diſcharg'd himſelf of his Commiſſion, with as much joy as a Man could be ſenſible of, who reveng'd the Publick upon his own particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Enemy. He beſet his Houſe with armed Soldiers, he waken'd him with a terrible noiſe, and ſignify'd the King's Order in expreſſions full of nipping raillerie; he would hardly give him time to put on his Cloaths, nor would he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him to go into his Study, nor to ſpeak to any body, but carry'd him away in all haſte to the Tower of <hi>Bourges.</hi>

<pb n="192" facs="tcp:53606:99"/> boldeſt and moſt ſuperb among. Men, before his fall, could not ſufficiently admire his abject puſillanimity and cowardize in his impriſonment. He tir'd both his Friends and his Enemies with unſeaſonable complaints, and ridiculous entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and left nothing omitted which he thought might inſpire compaſſion into the Ladies that he had offended, and made uſe of his liberty to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe his Pen, which was at length allow'd him to beg of the King, the Cardinal of <hi>Tournon,</hi> and Admiral <hi>Chabot,</hi> to redeem his Life and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty at the price of the vaſt Wealth which he had acquir'd. Nothing more manifeſtly prov'd him unworthy of his high fortune, then his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream deſire to ſurvive his diſgrace. His carriage quite chang'd that fear and averſion which People had againſt his Perſon, into a contempt which was no way advantageous to him; ſeeing that they left him for ſome years in the Tower of <hi>Bourges,</hi> without ſo much as thinking of him. At ength he was ſo importunate with the Miniſters of State, that they order'd him to be brought to his Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, but not after ſuch a method as he expected. For they appointed Commiſſioners to try him, choſen out of all the Parliaments of the Kingdom. However, they did him this juſtice, to make choice of the moſt able and the moſt honeſt: Nor were there ever in <hi>France</hi> any Judges, whoſe Probitie and Abilities were more univerſally known, then thoſe of <hi>Peter Raymund,</hi> Preſident of the Parliament of <hi>Rouen,</hi> who was order'd to draw up the Informations.

However it were, the Proceſs laſted till the year 1545. becauſe the Party accus'd finding himſelf abandon'd by all the world, and ready to ſink unrder the ſame Artifices, with which he had oppreſs'd others, made uſe of all the tricks that long experience had taught him, and ſummon'd up all his cunning, and his parts to defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. He led his Judges through all the by-paths of Subterfuge and Evaſion that Cavil could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, to elude, or at leaſt to delay his Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. He puzzl'd alike both his Judges and his Witneſſes that were brought Face to Face againſt him; and made ſo good a defence that he ſav'd his Life; whither it were that his Judges after a long debate, did not find reaſons enough to condemn him to Death, or that the too open animoſity of the proſecutors, had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd compaſſion into thoſe Magiſtrats, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading 'em he was Innocent, becauſe his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies were ſo violent in ſeeking his ruin.

The King ſurpriz'd at the mildneſs of

However his Majeſty remitted the puniſhment of Impriſonment, and <hi>Poyet</hi> was conſtrain'd for a Livelyhood, to reſume his firſt employment of Chamber-Counſellor in the Palace; deeming himſelf happy, that he had got himſelf out of the Bryars at any rate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Judges of approv'd integrity; for that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there was as many perſons convinc'd that he deſerv'd Death, as there were People that knew him.</p>

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:53606:101"/> For inſtead of managing to her advantage the Duke <hi>d' Eſtampes</hi> her Husband, whoſe humour inſenſible and little ſubject to the pleaſures of Love, might have been amus'd by ſlight marks of the King's liberality and vain employments, provided he had receiv'd 'em when he ſtood in need of 'em; ſhe had diſpleas'd him to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, as to incenſe him beyond the bounds of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, out of the ſtrangeſt capricio's, that ever jealouſy infus'd, to publiſh his own diſhonour by a judicial enquiry into the behaviour of his Wife, as we have already ſaid. This way of proceeding put the Dutcheſs out of all hopes of ever returning to her Husband, and reduc'd her to that miſery, that the Seneſchal's Wife, after the King's Death, made uſe of the jealous Duke, as an inſtrument to torment her, till her revenge was fully ſatiated.</p>
                  <p>Theſe inducements of terror that could not be either more powerful nor more probably grounded, oblig'd the Dutcheſs to ſeek out for an expedient to ſecure her from the impending ſtorm. And that which ſeem'd to her to be beſt and the moſt eaſie altogether, was to ſhroud her ſelf under the Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi>'s protection, and to ſet up a faction at Court ſo powerful in his favour, as to equal that which <hi>Diana</hi> had form'd for the Dauphin. The Dutches's aim was to ſeek for ſome great eſtabliſhment for the Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi> without the Kingdom, where ſhe might find that repoſe and ſecurity, which ſhe ſtood in need of. Nor was there any other eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment which he could pretend to, then what
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:53606:102"/> the Emperor had ſo many times propos'd, which was the inveſtiture of the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> or the Low Countries, upon two conditions. The one was, that he ſhould marry the Emperors Daughters, or his Niece. The other was, to prevent the Reunion of what ever ſhould be giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in favour of either of theſe two Matches, to the Crown of <hi>France.</hi> All the difficulty lay in the laſt Condition, to which the pretended ſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rility of the Dauphineſs, was an invincible ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle That Princeſs had been marry'd ten Years, yet never had any ſigns of a great Belly: and let the cauſe be what it would, from whence the defect proceeded, the Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi> would be ne'er the leſs preſumptive Heir to the Crown, nor by conſequence leſs capable, in the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors judgment, to hold the fiefs of <hi>Milan,</hi> and the Low Countries. <hi>Fernelius</hi> the Phyſitian af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had ſounded the Dauphineſſes temper, took a fancy that he could cure her indiſpoſition, and whither it were, that the Phyſick that he gave her wrought effectually, or that his ſecret conſiſted only in revealing to the Dauphin, the particular minutes wherein his Wife was moſt capable to conceive; the whole Court perceiv'd in a few Months after, that the Dauphineſs was big with Child.</p>
                  <p>The Dutcheſs's ſurprizing joy upon the news would not allow her ſo much liberty of thought at firſt, as to know the advantages that ſhe might draw from thence, but afterwards ſhe order'd the Emperor to be ſounded, whether he had any mind to engage the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> to his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:53606:102"/> or no. He that was entruſted with a Commiſſion ſo nice as this, had all the qualities ſufficient to begin ſo great an affair, but not thoſe that were proper to bring it to a concluſion. He was of the Illuſtrious Houſe of <hi>Longueval,</hi> and Count of <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſſu,</hi> and he had inſinuated himſelf into the friendſhip of the Dutcheſs, by the care which he took to improve her Eſtate, and give her notice of ſuch opportunities, as offer'd themſelves to encreaſe it, by begging vacant gratifications of the King. And in regard, he had Lands in the Low Countries, as well as in <hi>Picardy,</hi> he might without being ſuſpected, hold a correſpondence in both Provinces. He had both Wit and Addreſs, Reſolution and Reſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, but he was extreamly felt intereſted, and in regard he had a greater Eſtate in <hi>Flanders,</hi> then in <hi>France;</hi> that which he mainly aim'd at, was to eſtabliſh himſelf in the firſt of thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, where his poſterity afterwards fix'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and grew numerous.</p>
                  <p>This inducement made him accept of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to negotiate for the Dutcheſs; becauſe it would render him more conſiderable to the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria;</hi> and the Emperor overjoy'd to ſee ſo potent a faction among his Enemies that ſought to correſpond with him, look't upon this conjuncture, as a favour that Fortune offer'd him for the reſettlement of his affairs in the Low-Countries. He aſſur'd the Dutcheſs that he would give the Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi> the Duthy of <hi>Milan</hi> with his Niece, or the Low-Countries with his Daughter: and for ſear ſhe ſhould
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:53606:103"/> miſtruſt he would deceive her, becauſe he grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her demand ſo ſoon, and ſo readily; he add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he reſerv'd to himſelf the choice of the alternative, and that he would not be oblig'd to explain himſelf, nor to perform his promiſe, till he ſhould have made an agreement with the King; that is to ſay, till he ſhould reap all the effects of that friendſhip which the Dutcheſs and her faction could procure him, for thoſe remote pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, the performance of which, depended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his ſincerity.</p>
                  <p>The Count of <hi>Boſſu</hi> had underſtanding ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to perceive, that the Engagement was not reciprocal, but he ſhut his Eyes: and the Dutcheſs, from whom the Allurement of a retreating place, took away the ſight of the Serpent that lay under the flowers, perform'd her part in forming ſo ſtrict a League with the Emperor, that nothing paſt either at the Court, or in the Council of <hi>France,</hi> which was not immediatly conveigh'd to his knowledge. In ſhort, the firſt Letter that he receiv'd by the Counts means, did him ſo ſignal a piece of ſervice, that it ſav'd both his perſon and his whole Army. And the Emperor knew ſo well to make his advantage of the intelligence that ſhe gave him, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd <hi>France</hi> within two Fingers breadth of utter ruin. But Fortune having balanc'd his firſt ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, the Dutcheſs took an occaſion from thence to manage a peace between the two Crowns.</p>
                  <p>The reciprocal fears, of <hi>Francis</hi> I. and <hi>Charles</hi> V. were the foundation of a new intreague be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Queen <hi>Elenor</hi>'s and the Emperors Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:53606:103"/> both of 'em Dominican Fryars. The firſt was cal'd <hi>Diegos Chiavez,</hi> and the ſecond <hi>Gabriel de Guſman. Chiavez</hi> by virtue of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Order which he conceal'd, wrote to <hi>Guſman,</hi> as if he had pretended only to impart to him a thought that was come into his Head, that the greateſt good they could do both the one and the other, was to try, whither Divine Providence would make uſe of 'em, as Inſtruments to confound the Wiſdom of Men, by employing 'em to make that Peace which ſo many great perſonages could not conclude. <hi>Guſman</hi> preſently apprehended what lay conceal'd in his Brothers Letter, and ſhew'd it to Queen <hi>Eleonor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Queen held a correſpondence with the Dutcheſs <hi>d' Eſtampes,</hi> becauſe not having any Iſſue by the King, ſhe expected to be ſent back, ſo ſoon as ſhe ſhould be a Widow: and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſhe took no other care but to deſerve a favourable reception from the Emperor her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when ſhe ſhould return to reſide with him, by doing him good Service in an Enemies Court, whither ſhe had been baniſh'd under the ſpecious pretence of Matrimony. <hi>Guſman</hi> and the two Ladies labour'd ſo ſucceſsfully with <hi>Francis</hi> I. that that they caus'd him to patch up a Peace very advantageous to the Emperor, and to ſacrifice to the expectation of an imaginary Alliance, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral conſiderable places which enlarg'd the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors Frontiers, and ſecur'd 'em in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that for a long time there was no danger on that ſide. 'Tis true, that the courſe which the Dauphin took in cauſing the Conſtable to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call'd,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:53606:104"/> and putting him at the head of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, contributed not a little to make the King reſolve upon a Peace out of his averſion to the chief Officer of the Crown. But the Death of the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> which happen'd ſome time after, diſingag'd the Emperor from his promiſe, at a time when he ſaw himſelf oblig'd in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Treaty of <hi>Crepi,</hi> to reſolve upon the giving him his Daughter with the Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, or his Niece with the Dutchy of <hi>Milan.</hi> In the mean time <hi>Francis</hi> I after he had ſpun out his Diſtemper in ſeveral places, felt his Feaver ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch ſtrength upon him, at <hi>Rambouille<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:53606:105"/> and may I be aſſur'd that you have a real devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for my perſon? After he had ſworn, that ſhe might put him upon the Tryal, and that he was ready to ſacrifice his Life for her Intereſts, I know, purſu'd ſhe, that the credit I have at Court, engages all thoſe who have any Ambition, to offer me their ſervice; but I require from you more diſintereſted ſentiments: I would have it that you ſhould only Love in me what I hold from nature, without conſidering what I owe to the King's favours. I ſhall not be ungrateful; for I will take care of your fortune, provided you let me follow my own inclinations, and wholly confide in me. She accompany'd thoſe words with looks ſo paſſionate, that <hi>Briſſac</hi> who was no novice in Love, readily underſtood that it would be his fault, if he did not enter into a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Intreague with the Dutcheſs. He was in great danger of incurring the King's diſpleaſure, if a familiarity of that nature ſhould come to be diſcover'd; but more of falling under <hi>Diana</hi>'s indignation, if ſhe found her ſelf contemn'd, after ſhe had met him ſo far above half the way. Thereupon he never ſcrupl'd which courſe to take; and judging it became him not to neglect ſo fair an opportunity, he made no other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, then by a moſt paſſionate kiſs which he imprinted upon one of the Dutcheſſes hands. 'Tis not known whither <hi>Briſſac</hi> had any real paſſion for her; or whether he feign'd a true affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that he might make the beſt of her cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit; but certain it is, that they had ſeveral meetings.

One Evening that <hi>Briſſac</hi> had tarry'd ſomwhat later then ordinary, word was brought by ſome of the Attendants, that they had ſpi'd a light at the entrance into the Vault, and that moſt certainly the King was at hand. At which, the Dutcheſs being alarm'd, preſently ſent away <hi>Briſſac,</hi> who not far from the ſeparate Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment met <hi>Claude Tais,</hi> Grand Maſter of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, whether it were upon any Aſſignation hard by, or whether his muſing thoughts had led him ſo far that way.

The Queen Mother was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd Politian, and one who thought ſhe might make uſe of illegal, as well as legal ways, ſo ſhe might Reign. She was magnificent in all her actions, and lov'd all manner of divertiſements, which ſhe made ſubſervient to her Ambitious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns. During the troubles that turmoyl'd the State, the ſame Wagons that carry'd the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Ammunition, carry'd the Accoutrements for
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:53606:109"/> Balls and Maſquerades. By theſe Artifices it was that ſhe retain'd the Young Courtiers about her, who finding, in their attendance upon her plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, conformable to their Ages, and their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, and Charm'd with the beauty of her Maids of Honour, generally preferr'd her part before others that were ſet up in contempt of the Royal Authority. The Court was then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into two Factions, Huguenots and zealous Catholicks. <hi>Lewis</hi> Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> headed the firſt, and the <hi>Guiſes</hi> govern'd the ſecond. The King of <hi>Navarr,</hi> the Conſtable, and the Marſhal <hi>de St. Andrè,</hi> ſeem'd to make a third party, and the Queen's aim was to preſerve the Authority, which the Regency gave her, by dividing and balancing theſe three cabals, in ſuch a manner, that the one ſhould not oppreſs the other two. The third party, which was uſually call'd the <hi>Triumvirate,</hi> ſeem'd to her to be moſt powerful, and ſhe made uſe of the Dutcheſs of <hi>Valentinois</hi> to divide the King of <hi>Navarr</hi> and the Conſtable, for fear leaſt being united, they ſhould leave her no more then the ſhadow of Government. And the Dutcheſs undertook it ſo much the more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, becauſe her Intereſts agreed beſt with the Queen's She feign'd as if ſhe had ſuffer'd her ſelf to be over-rul'd by the tears of her eldeſt Daughter, and the ſubmiſſions of the Duke of <hi>Aumale</hi> her Son in Law, to reconcile her ſelf and renew her good correſpondence with the Houſe of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> which had abandon'd her to the mercy of her Enemies: and the Court took this reunion for an effect of Heroic. Virtue, thaô in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:53606:110"/> an indiſpenſable neceſſity was the only motive that induc'd her to it. The Dutcheſs had both Wit and experience enough to Judge, that 'twas impoſſible for her to preſerve the vaſt wealth which ſhe enjoy'd, but by the ſupport of the Houſe of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> which was not in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to hold up any long time, but by a recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with the Conſtable: ſo that indeed the Dutcheſs labour'd for her ſelf, while the Queen and the Duke of <hi>Aumale</hi> fancy'd to themſelves, that ſhe acted for them. In a word, ſhe made ſuch effectual uſe of the Authority which ſhe had ſtill over the Conſtable, that ſhe accuſtom'd him by degrees, not to look upon the <hi>Guiſes</hi> any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as his Enemies. Thus the Dutcheſs main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd her ſelf till ſhe dy'd in the ſame flouriſhing condition, wherein <hi>Henry</hi> II. had left her, no body daring to croſs her any more, when they ſaw her have ſuch potent protectors.</p>
                  <p>But it was not enough for the Queen to have broken the <hi>Triumvirate:</hi> it behov'd her alſo, that ſhe might get all the power into her hands, to faſten to her Intereſts the two Princes of the Houſe of <hi>Bourbon.</hi> And in regard ſhe knew that Love was the moſt powerful engine to move the inclinations of that Age, ſhe made uſe of the Charms of her Maids of Honour to bring about her deſign. The two moſt amiable were, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demoiſelle <hi>du Rouet,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Lewis de la Berandiere de Guiche,</hi> Lord of the Iſland of <hi>Rouet</hi> in <hi>Poitou,</hi> and <hi>Mademoiſelle de Limueil.</hi> The firſt undertook the Conqueſt of the King of <hi>Navarr,</hi> and the ſecond to ſubdue the Prince
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:53606:110"/> of <hi>Condè.</hi> To that purpoſe, <hi>M. de Rouet,</hi> wherever ſhe came, ſpoke ſo highly in praiſe of the King of <hi>Navarr,</hi> that ſhe infus'd into him a long deſire to knoe who it was that ſo much oblig'd him with her encomiums in all companies. Mademoiſelle <hi>de Limueil,</hi> on the otherſide, ſaid nothing that could reflect upon the reputation of the Prince of <hi>Condè,</hi> but ſtill ſhe gave out every where, that he ſhould be the laſt Man that ſhe ſhould make choice of for a Lover: becauſe he was naturally unconſtant, and minding no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much as his Ambition, he could not condeſcend to thoſe petty complaiſancies that more frequently win upon the affections of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, then great Services. The Prince of <hi>Condè,</hi> hearing of theſe diſcourſes, thought himſelf bound in Honour to undeceive <hi>M. de Limueil,</hi> and by that means fell into her ſnare. The Queen at firſt had govern'd the King of <hi>Navarr</hi> by the Artifices of the Dutcheſs of <hi>Montpenſier,</hi> who had ſuch an aſcendant over him, that at Court ſhe was call'd nothing but the <hi>Syren.</hi> The Queen was alſo beholding to this Dutcheſs for cauſing the King to deſiſt from his pretenſions to the Regency, and content himſelf with the ſhadow of Authority, in accepting the Lieutenancy Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the State, that ſhe might enjoy the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. In vain his Friends remonſtrated to him, that he ſhould want neither Counſel nor power to force obedience to himſelf; but the Dutcheſs of <hi>Montpenſier</hi>'s perſwaſions prevail'd with him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all the remonſtrances of <hi>Mon moranci, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillon,</hi> the Calviniſts, and the more clear ſighted
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:53606:111"/> Catholicks. But thó the Queen had been ſo well ſerv'd by this Princeſs, ſhe was afraid leſt her Ambition ſhould infuſe into her a deſire of ſharing her Authority. And rather choſe to make uſe of <hi>M. de Rouet,</hi> with whom the King of <hi>Navarr</hi> took delight to converſe, after ſhe declar'd her ſelf to be ſo much Charm'd with his Vertues. The King therefore quite tyr'd with the long reſiſtance which the Dutcheſs's Virtue had made to his deſires, thought he might quit her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being accus'd of inconſtancy, that he might devote himſelf to a perſon, with whom in all probability he ſhould better employ his aſſiduities and where he ſhould meet with as much Wit and Beauty.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1561</label> Some time after, Ambition had like to have broken off the intercourſes of thoſe two Ladies. For the Catholick King, by <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riquez,</hi> whom he ſent to him on purpoſe, made a propoſal to the King of <hi>Navarr,</hi> which upon a ſlight examination only, ſeem'd very advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous to him. The ſubſtance of it was, that he ſhould put himſelf at the head of the zealous Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks who were about to baniſh <hi>Calviniſm</hi> out of <hi>France:</hi> that he ſhould diſſolve his Marriage with <hi>Joan d'Albret,</hi> under pretence of Hereſie, and marry <hi>Mary Stuart,</hi> the wife of <hi>Francis</hi> II. who would bring him in Dowrie the Crowns of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> M. <hi>de Roouet,</hi> Who was fall'n in love with the King, while ſhe only ſought to intangle him in her ſnares, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inform'd of this Negotiation by <hi>d' Eſcars,</hi>
                     <pb n="217" facs="tcp:53606:111"/> one of her Favourites, was extreamly allarum'd at it. Thereupon ſhe ſought an opportunity to ſpeak in private with the King of <hi>Navarr;</hi> and having met with one, ſhe never left him, till ſhe had made him promiſe her to ſend back <hi>Manriquez,</hi> without concluding upon any thing.</p>
                  <p>But thô the King of <hi>Navarr</hi> were prone enough of himſelf to do what ſhe deſir'd, and that he abhorr'd the propoſal of a Divorce, he forbore not however to make M. <hi>de Rouet</hi> ſenſible of a valuable Sacrifice which he had made her of the faireſt Queen in <hi>Europe,</hi> and drew a promiſe from her, that ſhe would not refuſe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts of his Love. So that now there wanted nothing but to find out opportunities, which it was no difficult thing to meet with. For the Court being then at <hi>Fontain-bleau,</hi> the ſame Evening he beſtow'd a Conſort of Violins upon the Ladies near the <hi>Caual,</hi> and while they were buſie in hearkning to the Muſick, or elſe a Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, he went aſide with M. <hi>de Rouet,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd ſo well the favourable inclination to which he had prepar'd her, that ſhe became big of a Prince, who was call'd <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> and afterwards was made Archbiſhop of <hi>Rouen.</hi> But the Prince of <hi>Coudè</hi> had not that great ſucceſs with M. <hi>de Limeuil.</hi> For as ſhe had declar'd at firſt a diſlike of that Prince's humour, ſhe was oblig'd to obſerve certain outward formalities of diſdain, and to make ſhew of an indifferency, which however was far from real, the more to fire her Lover; which was the reaſon that it was leſs trouble to her Virtue to hold out ſo much the longer.</p>
                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:53606:112"/>
                  <p>Theſe two Ladies, that liv'd together in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Union, were not a little troubl'd to ſee the two Brothers engag'd in different Parties: while the eldeſt Brother commanded the Catholick, the youngeſt the <hi>Calviniſt</hi> Army. The King of <hi>Navarr</hi> being wounded at the Siege of <hi>Rouen,</hi> was carry'd into the City after it was taken, and was there frequently viſited by M. <hi>du Rouet,</hi> and in regard their converſation was a little too vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous, the King's wound feſter'd to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that it became mortal. The Queen Regent, ſeeing how little hopes there was of ſaving his life, admoniſh'd him to prepare himſelf for death: he took the advice of that Princeſs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing, all of a ſuddain, his inclinations both to Honour and Pleaſure, he admitted no more viſits from the Ladies, and declar'd to <hi>Chanto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay,</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador, and Brother of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Grandvelle,</hi> that he thought no farther of <hi>Sardigna,</hi> which the King of <hi>Spain</hi> offer'd him in exchange for <hi>Navarr.</hi> After he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd himſelf to the Official of <hi>Rouen,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd both the Sacraments, he ſo earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd to he carry'd down the River to his Houſe at <hi>St. Maur,</hi> where the Air was incomparably much better then at <hi>Rouen,</hi> that they were forc'd to tranſport him thither, and at firſt he ſeem'd to be much better upon the water; but a cold Sweat that ſeiz'd him at <hi>Andilli,</hi> enforcing him to make a ſtop there, he dy'd the 7th of <hi>Octob.</hi> 1562. in the Two and fortieth year of his age, and deliver'd the Regent from her continual fears, leſt he ſhould change his Party. 'Twould
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:53606:112"/> be a difficult thing to expreſs the extream ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row that overwhelm'd Mademoiſelle <hi>de Rouet,</hi> for the loſs of a Prince whom ſhe dearly lov'd, and by whom ſhe was no leſs tenderly belov'd, more eſpecially being conſcious to her ſelf, that ſhe had contributed to his death.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1563</label> The next year the Queen Regent found a way to conclude a Peace with the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſts,</hi> and to draw the Prince of <hi>Condè</hi> to Court; where he was ſo well treated, that he forgot for ſome time his warlike humour. The Honours paid to the deceaſed King of <hi>Navarr,</hi> his Brother, to retain him in the Catholick party, were nothing in compariſon of thoſe that were conferr'd upon him, to bring him off from Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſm. He was every Day with the Queen, who heap'd civilities upon him. Nothing of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance was debated in Council, nor in any other place but in his preſence: he generally obtain'd whatever he deſir'd, and all occaſions of giving him offence were carefully avoided. 'Twas not believ'd however that he ſuffer'd himſelf to be amus'd with promiſes, which he ſaw fruſtrated of their principal effect, ſince they delay'd to give him the Lieutenancy General, of which the Queen had put him in hopes; for fear, as was given out, leſt the Catholicks, who were diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfi'd with the Peace, ſhould take from thence the pretence they ſought for to break it: but Love ſided with the party, and ſeconded the Artifices of the Queen. For the Prince of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de</hi>'s paſſion for <hi>M. de Limueil</hi> was not quite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh'd,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:53606:113"/> thô it had lain dormant for ſome time as being benumm'd by the fatigues of the War. The preſence of the beloved object, having rows'd his Affection, he apply'd himſelf afreſh to the Lady, and gave her ſuch publick proofs of his tenderneſs that the Princeſs his Wife, who could not be ignorant of it, ſickn'd of jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie and Di'd.</p>
                  <p>The Regent intent upon all occaſions that might conduce to confirm her Authority, look't upon this conjuncture as one of the moſt favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable that could have befallen her. She imagin'd that as the <hi>Chatillon</hi>'s had engag'd the Prince in Hereſy, by the Marriage of their Neice, ſhe might alſo bring him back to the Communion of the Church, by giving him for a ſecond Wife, a Lady that had the Honour to be her kinſwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, whoſe Charms would put a ſtop to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy, and draw from his Lips the ſecrets of the <hi>Calviniſts.</hi> To this purpoſe, ſhe commanded the Lady to leave nothing omitted, upon that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſition, to omit nothing that might contribute to detain the Prince in her Fetters. But to venture an indifferent virtue with a Lover who made uſe of the ſmalleſt advantages in Love, as in War, to carry things to extremity, was to expoſe it to too many hazards. While the Lady feign'd an Affection for the Prince, ſhe became inamour'd in good earneſt; and to her misfortune, ſhe was not the only perſon at Court, that found her Heart inſenſibly engag'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Margaret de Luſtrac</hi> the Widow of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal <hi>de St. Andrè,</hi> was neither of a temper nor
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:53606:113"/> inclination to ſpend the remainder of her Life in Widowhood; nevertheleſs, ſhe was engag'd to it in ſome meaſure, by ſigning the Articles of the Marriage of her only Daughter with the Eldeſt Son of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe;</hi> ſeeing it was chiefly concluded conſideration of the great Eſtate that ſhe poſſeſs'd; and for that the Marſhal her Husband had been preſerv'd from inevitable ruin. However, ſhe was no ſooner a Widow but ſhe yielded to the uſual temptation of perſons of her Quality; ſo that ſhe laid a deſign to marry again, and break off the Match between her Daughter and the Prince of <hi>Joinville.</hi> For which, that ſhe might have a plauſible pretence, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to cover what was irregular in her intentions, ſhe feign'd to ſeek out a more Honourable alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for her Daughter, and caſt her Eyes upon the Marquiſs of <hi>Conti,</hi> the Eldeſt Son of the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> with an intent to perſwade the leſs diſcerning ſort of People, that if ſhe mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd the Prince, 'twas only to facilitate the union of their Children by her Marriage. But ſhe could not have addreſs'd her ſelf more unluckily, conſidering how things ſtood with the Prince at that time. For thô he had not had a kindneſs for Madam <hi>de Limueil;</hi> he would have preferr'd a Country Girl before the remains of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal <hi>de St Andrè.</hi> However he did not explain his thoughts to the perſons that propounded his Marriage with the Widow, as the only means to ſecure to his Son, the Marriage of St. <hi>Andrè</hi>'s Heireſs; he only repli'd, that the way did not ſeem to him to be ſo infallible, becauſe the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:53606:114"/> not being above nine Years of Age, and for that both the Nuptials could not be ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niz'd at the ſame time, the Marſhaleſs, would be as her liberty, when ſhe was become a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to break the Articles between her Daughter and the Marqueſs, with the ſame eaſe as ſhe had broken her Covenants with the Prince of <hi>Join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville.</hi> The Marſhaleſs inform'd of this obſtacle, and taking no other advice but that of her own paſſion, offer'd the Prince a deed of gift of the manner of <hi>Valeri</hi> in <hi>Gatinois,</hi> and all the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent moveables with which the Marſhal of <hi>St. Andrè</hi> had furniſh'd it. 'Twas thought that by this peice of unpararallel'd liberality, ſhe thought to have fix'd that levity of which ſhe was ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to be guilty, by diſabling her ſelf to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe her Daughter to the Son of a Prince, to whom ſhe would have given beforehand the beſt part of her Eſtate; and to have ſupplanted her Rivaleſs by the force of her Acts of kindneſs, ſince ſhe could not do it by the power of her Charms. The preſent was accepted, without producing, however, the effect which the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhalleſs expected from it: whither it were too great to be refus'd by a Prince, whoſe birth was nevertheleſs too ſpendidly exalted to engage him by the acceptance of it; or whither the Prince blam'd in his own thoughts the prodiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Widow, at the ſame time that he made a benefit of it.</p>
                  <p>Mademoiſelle <hi>de Limueil</hi> made reflections re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from Truth upon an accident ſo rarely hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening. She ſuppos'd the Prince leſs amorous
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:53606:114"/> or leſs concerned then he was; and imagin'd that ſince he had accepted the ſigniory of <hi>Valleri,</hi> he would have marry'd the Marſhalleſs. The ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition of which encreas'd to that degree, that not having an Eſtate ſufficient to equal the libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of her Rivalleſs, ſhe took a fancy to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs it by granting the Prince the deareſt Jewel ſhe had in the World. And her big Belly that ſoon attended the fault the had committed, made it ſo publick, that ſhe was forc'd to withdraw from the Court. The Queen caus'd her to be conducted by a <hi>Valet de Chambre,</hi> whoſe name was <hi>Gentil,</hi> to the Convent of Franciſcans in the City of <hi>Auxonne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This baniſhment of <hi>M. de Limueil</hi> was not the only puniſhment of her incontinency. For the Prince equally touch'd with diſdain as well of a Widow who had aſpir'd to an Alliance with him, as of a Young Lady that ſought to gain him by an over paſſionate ſubmiſſion, neglected both the one and the other, to marry <hi>Franceſe</hi> of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leance,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Longuevilles</hi> Siſter; a haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Princeſs, and of an auſtere Virtue. Such a difference he put between the diſpoſitions of thoſe Women which he deſir'd for his Wives, and thoſe which he ſought for his Miſtreſses. Mademoiſelle <hi>de Limueil</hi> after the was brought to Bed, endeavour'd to repair the loſs of her high hopes by marrying <hi>Geoffrey de Cauſac,</hi> Lord of <hi>Tremon,</hi> who had been a long time an humble ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of hers, but had been neglected by her ever ſince her Intreague with the Prince of <hi>Condè.</hi> Nor was Mademoiſelle <hi>de Rohan</hi> better treated
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:53606:115"/> by the Duke of <hi>Nemours:</hi> ſhe had granted him the ſame favours, upon a promiſe of Marriage, in the Reign of <hi>Henry II.</hi> But the Prince, to avoid the performance of his word, went to ſerve in <hi>Piedmont</hi> againſt the Duke of <hi>Savoy;</hi> nor did he return into <hi>France</hi> till the beginning of the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the IX. at which time he threw himſelf into the Cabal of the <hi>Guiſes;</hi> and ſo frequently viſited the Dukes Wife, that he could no longer remain inſenſible of her Charms. Nevertheleſs he durſt not diſcover his paſſion to her, ſuch was the awe that her Virtue had upon him. However in regard it is as difficult a thing to hide Love as to conceal Fire, <hi>M de Rohan</hi> was inform'd of his infidelity, and reſolving re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, ſhe ſu'd him upon his promiſe. He pleaded her profeſſion of the pretended Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and having obtain'd from the Pope a nullity of the Engagements he had made her, He marry'd the Widow of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> who was Murder'd by <hi>Poltrot</hi> before <hi>Orleance,</hi> ſome Months before.</p>
                  <p>After Queen <hi>Katherine de Medicis</hi> had caus'd the majority of her Son to be declar'd by the Parliament of <hi>Rouen,</hi> all the Court Ladies ſtrove which ſhould moſt powerfully enthral his Heart; but he delighted more in Hunting and other vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent exerciſes, then in Courtſhip and making Love. Nevertheleſs one Day, Madam <hi>de Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſier</hi> taxing him for his inſenſibility, he ſwore to her, that if once he went about to turn <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet,</hi> he ſhould ſo haraſs all the Ladies, that they would repent of having wak'd a ſleeping Lyon.
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:53606:115"/> In a word, for ſome time he lay'd about him to the right and left, without ever engaging him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in any Intreagues. But ſometime after go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Orleance,</hi> he ſpy'd a young Virgin, that came out of curioſity to ſee him at Dinner, and having enquir'd who ſhe was, he learnt that her name was <hi>Marie Touchet,</hi> an Apothecary's Daughter i'the Town. Thereupon, he commanded <hi>la Tour,</hi> Maſter of the Wardrobe to talk to her, and to perſwade her to come to his Chamber. <hi>La Tour</hi> with very little trouble ſucceeded in his Negotiation, and the next night brought Madam <hi>Touchet</hi> to the King, who obtain'd of her what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he deſir'd, thô ſhe had already engag'd her Affection to <hi>Monlue,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Valence</hi>'s Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whom ſhe could not forget neither, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever marks ſhe receiv'd of <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninths Love. The King requeſted Madam <hi>Margaret</hi> his Siſter, to entertain her as her waiting Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that ſhe might have ſome pretence to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Court. However he was forc'd to take her away from that Lady, when he return'd to <hi>Paris,</hi> becauſe ſhe prov'd with Child: and he provided ſo well for her lying Inn, that ſhe was brought to Bed of a Prince, who was call'd <hi>Charles</hi> by his Father's name, and honour'd with the title of Count of <hi>Auvergne.</hi> But Madam <hi>Touchet</hi> for all this, kept a dayly correſpondence with <hi>Monlue,</hi> and frequently receiv'd <hi>Billet Douxes</hi> from him. The King being inform'd that ſhe had put one of 'em up in her purſe, invited a great many Ladies to Supper, of which number was his faithleſs Miſtreſs. Withal he commanded the Captain
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:53606:116"/> of a Company of Gypſies to bring along with him about a dozen of the moſt exquiſite Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purſes he could pick out of the whole gang, to cut all the Ladies purſes while they were Eating, and faithfully to bring 'em all to him at his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Bed. When the Meat was upon the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, he plac'd Madam <hi>Touchet</hi> next to himſelf, for fear ſhe ſhould make away the Billet, which be had a mind to have. The Cutpurſes did their buſineſs exactly, and <hi>la Chambre</hi> fail'd not to carry to the King all the booty according to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. The King had no great trouble to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh his Miſtreſs's purſe from the reſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore opening it in very great haſt, found there the Billet already mention'd. The next Day he ſhew'd it his diſloyal Minioneſs, who diſown'd it was directed to her, becauſe there was no Superſcription; bur ſhe could not diſavow ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other things that were in the Purſe, together with the Billet; ſo that having no other courſe to take, ſhe confeſt her fault, and beg'd pardon. The King alſo promis'd to think no more of it, provided ſhe had no more to do with <hi>Monlue,</hi> and to ſeparate her the more certainly from him, His Majeſty Marry'd her to <hi>Balzac d'Entragues,</hi> Bayliff of <hi>Orleance.</hi> Some time after, the diſcourſe was very hot, about marrying the King to <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> the Emperor <hi>Ferdinand</hi>'s Daughter. Madam <hi>d'Entragues,</hi> having ſeen her Picture, conſulted her Looking-glaſs, and then told one of her Maids that ſtood by her, that 'twas the leaſt of her fears, that ever that Princeſs would rob her of the King's Affection:
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:53606:116"/> and indeed he lov'd her to his Dying Day, tho' he had a great reſpect for the Queen his Wife.</p>
                  <p>The King was extreamly haughty and could not brook the ambition of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> He took it hainouſly when he underſtood that the Duke had been ſo bold as to aſpire to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>Margaret</hi> his Siſter, as alſo to make her a formal Declaration of his Love. So that in the firſt tranſports of his wrath, he order'd the Grand Prior, the Son of <hi>Hen.</hi> II. and Madam <hi>Hamilton,</hi> to ſtab the inſolent Pretender. Of which, the Duke being inform'd by Madam <hi>d'Entragues,</hi> avoided the Hunting match, which was appointed on purpoſe for the execution of the deſign that was laid againſt his life. And to let the King know that he was not guilty of the crime that was laid to his charge, by the advice of his Mother, he marry'd <hi>Katherine</hi> of <hi>Cleves,</hi> the Widow of Prince <hi>Portiano,</hi> and by that means aſſwag'd his Maſters anger. In the mean time he endeavour'd to ſecure to himſelf the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the Duke of <hi>Anjou;</hi> and the better to gain his good Will, he offer'd to be ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to him in his paſſion for the Princeſs of <hi>Condè,</hi> his Siſter-in-law. So violent was the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi>'s love for that Princeſs, that he was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry near refuſing the Crown of <hi>Poland,</hi> as not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during a removal from her. However, he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to cure himſelf by ſeeking other diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements, and made his applications to Madam <hi>Chaſteau-neuf,</hi> one of the Queen Mother's Maids of Honour, who did not long withſtand his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities: and in regard ſhe perceiv'd her ſelf to
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:53606:117"/> be not the ſole Miſtreſs of his Heart, ſhe made no ſcruple to engage her ſelf in an Intreague with <hi>Lignerolet,</hi> the Duke's Favourite. But <hi>Ligneroles, s</hi> who devoted himſelf to her onely out of vanity, was ſo indiſcreet as to boaſt to his Maſter of his good Fortune, and receiv'd the puniſhment which his inſolence deſerv'd, being ſtabb'd be <hi>Villequier,</hi> by the Duke's Order. They who were ignorant of this circumſtance, aſcrib'd his death to his indiſcretion, in talking of the Maſſacre that was to be made of the <hi>Huguenots</hi> upon <hi>St. Bartholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mews</hi> day, which his Maſter had reveal'd to him, but certain it is, that the Duke had no other aim then to puniſh the Vain-glory of his Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite. The Duke finding that the Princeſs of <hi>Condè</hi>'s Virtue was not to be ſtirr'd, ſet forward at length for <hi>Poland,</hi> where they would fain have marry'd him to <hi>Ann Jaqueline,</hi> the Daughter of the laſt King. But the news that he receiv'd in a ſhort time after, of the death of <hi>Chales</hi> IX. oblig'd him to quit his new Subjects, and return into <hi>France.</hi> The King, at the very laſt minutes of his life, could not forget Madam <hi>d'Entragues;</hi> but order'd <hi>La Tour</hi> to tell her, that nothing griev'd him ſo much, as that death had ſnatch'd him from her, before he had done any thing for her to advance her Fortune.</p>

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſend off this blow, ſhe ſet all the moſt charming Ladies of the Court at work to inveigle her Sons affections. <hi>Mademoiſelle de Chateauncuf</hi> amus'd him for ſome time, but was oblig'd to give way to <hi>Mademoiſelle de E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Sauve,</hi> the Secretary of States Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow was ſhe that triumph'd at laſt over all the Rivaleſſes: The King gave himſelf ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly up to Her; but the engagement was not reciprocal, becauſe ſhe lov d the King of <hi>Navarr.</hi> Their Intreague firſt began, while <hi>Navarr</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Alenſon</hi> were Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners together, and Madam <hi>de Sauve</hi> was wont to go and bear 'em company, meerly to divert 'em, and alleviate the vexations of their impriſonment. Theſe two Princeſs fell equally in love with her; but ſhe had not the ſame kind ſentiments for both. She hated the Duke of <hi>Alenſon,</hi> but ſhe made favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able returns to the tender addreſſes of the King of <hi>Navarr.</hi> When that Prince was ſet at

But ſhe made no other uſe of his complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, then to ſecond the Queen Mothers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, which was to revive in his heart that tenderneſs which he had formerly had for <hi>Mademoiſelle de Vaudemont,</hi> and to perſwade him to ſeat her by him upon the Throne.

The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> was become an inamor'd Servant of hers, and had inſenſibly baniſh'd from his heart the tenderneſs which he had for the Queen of <hi>Navarr;</hi> and ſhe thought to do him a great piece of ſervice, by advancing his Kinſwoman to that high degree of honour, which would oblige him to love her the more. And the death of the Princeſs of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de</hi> which happen'd about the ſame time, gave Madam <hi>de Sauve</hi> a fair opportunity to engage him with <hi>Mademoiſelle de Vaudemont.</hi> The King ſaw her as he was going to be Crown'd at <hi>Rheims,</hi> and finding in her face the ſame Allurements that had formerly charm'd him, he reſolv'd at length to marry her.</p>

Henry III. who knew it, had a deſire to marry him to <hi>Mademoiſelle de Chaſteauneuf,</hi> and whether he thought it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came him to take care of the Fortune of a Perſon whom he had once lov'd, or that he took ſome kind of Pleaſure to change Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes with <hi>Luxemburgh,</hi> he propos'd it to him upon his Coronation Day: To which the Lord made anſwer, that he had ſo great a value for whatever concern'd the Queen, that he could but be highly overjoy'd at the advantage which fortune had procur'd her, and that he applauded her for having made ſo happy a change of her Lover. But in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard there was not ſo much to be got by him in marrying <hi>Mademoiſelle de Chaſteauneuf,</hi> he beſought his Majeſty to allow him time to conſider. The King repli'd, that it was not for him to heſitate upon what he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propos'd to him, and therefore he expect'd to be forthwith obey'd. <hi>Luxemburgh</hi> finding himſelf ſo vigorouſly preſs'd upon, deſired eight days to prepare himſelf, and obtain'd three, which ſerv'd him to find a way to quit the Court, and retire in a place where he might ſhelter himſelf from the King's diſpleaſure. Nor did the King, whoſe firſt tranſports were only to be fear'd, think any more of him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after he was once got out of his ſight.

               <p>By this Satyr it may be ſeen, that the King affected to appear devout in publick, but in private abandond himſelf to all manner of voluptuous ſenſuality, without any moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and the Queen-mother was ſo far from reſtraining him, that ſhe indulg'd him in his humours, that ſhe might have the greater ſhare in the Government.

               <p>Some months after, there was great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying at Court upon the Marriage of the Queens Siſter <hi>Mademoiſelle de Vaudemont</hi> with <hi>d'Argues,</hi> whom the King had made Duke of <hi>Joyeuſe.</hi> All the Ladies made their appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the place moſt magnificently adorn'd; there were Maſquerades, Balls, Runnings at the Ring and Tournaments. <hi>Ranſard</hi> and <hi>Baif</hi> had each of 'em a thouſand Crowns a piece for Epithalamiums and Verſes upon the Subject of that Feſtival. All the Princes, to collogue with the King, treated the new marri'd Couple, every one in their turn.

But this Machine did not take effect. So that the King was forc'd to go in his Coach to the Abby. But this defect was repair'd by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Gallantries; among which there was an Artificial Garden, adorn'd with all the beautiful products of the Spring, tho it

When the King treated the ſame Company at the <hi>Louvre,</hi> he caus'd a Ball to be daunc'd, which repreſented the divertiſements of <hi>Ceres</hi> and her Nymphs.

                  <p>When he return'd to <hi>Mante,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Bellegarde</hi> begg'd leave of his Majeſty, that he might go to <hi>Coeuvres,</hi> where <hi>Gabriella d' Eſtrees</hi> then reſided, with whom he was deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in love, and for whoſe ſake he had quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Madam <hi>d'Humieres,</hi> tho ſhe had taken great care of him during a ſickneſs that had held him for ſome time at <hi>Mante,</hi> and had alſo ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crafic'd for his ſake the Admiral <hi>de Villars,</hi> who had left nothing omitted to gain her affections.

Upon his return, he apply'd himſelf more ſedulouſly to <hi>Mademoiſelle d'Eſtrees</hi> then ever, and declar d openly, in the tone of a Maſter, that he would have no Companion. If the Duke Of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueville</hi> were not a little diſconſolate, <hi>Belle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard</hi> was much more, who was to renounce a Heart of which he had been in poſſeſſion, whereas <hi>Longueville</hi> built upon a foundation of ill grounded hopes.

But ſhe was not ſo moderate herſelf: for ſhe flew out againſt the King, and told him with an extraordinary reſolution, that ſhe would be free in her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, and that he would but incur her Hatred, if he hinder'd her from marrying <hi>Bellegard,</hi> which was a match that had been agreed upon with the goodliking of her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.

                  </p>
                  <p>Her Anger and her departure equally afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the King, and he reſolv'd to make uſe of the greateſt Submiſſion that might be to gain her Favour. The main difficulty was which way to get to <hi>Coeuvres,</hi> in regard he was to travel ſeven Leagues in the Enemies Country: nor could he march with a numerous Convoy, without making his Paſſion known, and giving his Miſtreſs a new occaſion of Diſtaſt; ſo that he ran a great Hazard with a few Men, For that the Country was cover'd with the Enemies Forces, and there was a neceſſity for him to croſs a very dangerous Forreſt. However he took the laſt Reſolution, love cauſing him to ſhut his Eyes againſt all other conſiderations. Thereupon he got a Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back with five or ſix of his Officers in whom he moſt confided, whom he diſmis'd when he came within three Leagues of the Caſtle of <hi>Coeuvres;</hi> and when he was alone, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted, diſguiz'd himſelf in the Habit of a Peaſant, and taking a ſack full of Straw upon his back, trud'g on with his Burden till he came to his journeys end. <hi>Mademoiſelle d' Eſtrees,</hi> who together with her Siſter Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Villars</hi> ſtood at the Window of a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, that over look't the Country, ſaw the Countreyman at a diſtance, but never dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuch a Fantaſtick adventure, n'ere ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd his Face. When the King came into the Court of the Caſtle, he threw down his
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53606:125"/> Burthen, and going directly up Staires, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking notice of any body, to the place where he had ſeen her ſtand who was the cauſe of his Diſguiſe, he accoſted her after a moſt ſubmiſſive manner. But he ſurpriz'd her extreamly, when ſhe perceiv'd him in a Garb ſo little conformable to his dignity, and far from being oblig'd to him for what he had done for her ſake, ſhe receiv'd him with a diſdainful look, which was more ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Habit which he wore, then the Luſter of his Birth. So ſtrangely does ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred Impoyſon the moſt Heroick Actions. Had <hi>Bellegard</hi> done as much for her ſake, ſhe would have valu'd it at a high Rate, becauſe ſhe lov'd him; but ſhe took it ill at the King's Hands, becauſe ſhe had no kindneſs for him. She bid him with a Scornful Aire go and ſhift his Cloaths if he intended to ſtay with Her, and ſo ſomewhat rudely flung out of the Room, leaving her Siſter to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe her incivility.</p>
                  <p>While the King took this unprofitable Journney, the whole Court was in a ſtrange diſorder; nor did they come to themſelves till the King's return diſperc'd all their fears He ſtay'd not at all at <hi>Coeuvres,</hi> finding it in vain to tarry, ſince he could not oblige <hi>Mademoiſelle d' Eſtrees</hi> to ſhew him the leaſt Favour. However he appear'd for ſome time with ſuch a Melancholy Countenance, that they who ſaw him ſo diſconſolate, thought verily he had loſt the half of his Kingdom.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53606:125"/> But coming at length too himſelf, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied himſelf to Publick buſineſs, as he was wont to doe: yet not being able to baniſh from his Heart the ungrateful <hi>Mademoiſelle d' Eſtrees,</hi> he ſent word to her Father that 'twas his pleaſure to admit him into his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Council, on purpoſe to oblige him to come to <hi>Mante</hi> with his whole Family. The favour's which were beſtow'd upon the Father oblig'd the Daughter to uſe the King a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more civily. But in regard he was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blig'd to be every hour on Horſeback, either to execute ſome Enterprize upon his Enemies, or to prevent their Deſigns, he could not be conſtantly with her.</p>
                  <p>During the King's Abſence, <hi>Mademoiſelle d' Eſtrees</hi> continu'd her Familiarity with <hi>Belle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard:</hi> nor did ſhe ſurceaſe giving an Ear to the Duke of <hi>Longueville,</hi> nor to write to him, not to receive Letters from him.

And indeed ſhe was very ſincere in bringing all the Letters which ſhe had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53606:126"/> from the Duke: but the Duke was not ſo ingenious as to bring all the Letters ſhe had written to him, but kept the moſt tender, by that ſame pledge to keep her as it were under a kind of dependency. But ſhe was extreamly incens'd at his perfidiouſneſs, and to revenge he ſelf did the Duke of <hi>Langue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi> ſo many ill Offices with the King, that finding the Court a place where he receiv'd nothing but new Affronts every day, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged himſelf in a treaſonable League, and was ſlain making his entry into <hi>Dourlans</hi> with a Musket from a Volley of Honour that was given him by the Garriſon. Some there were who accus'd Madam <hi>d' Eſtrees</hi> to have hir'd a Soldier to take away his Life, who made uſe of that opportunity; nor was it without ſome probability.</p>
                  <p>But notwithſtanding all the care which the King took to oblige the Marquiſs <hi>de Coeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vres</hi> by his Favours, he could not win him to like well his ſedulities to his Daughter, fearing leaſt ſhe ſhould compleat the diſhonor of his Family, of which the Marchioneſs his Wife had already began to ſtain the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For ſhe like a ſhameleſs Woman had follow'd the Marquiſs <hi>d' Allegre</hi> into <hi>Auvergne,</hi> and there liv d with him in a publick Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binage, not minding the ſcandal, or what the world ſaid of her. The Marquiſs therefore fearing leaſt it ſhould be laid to his charge if Madam <hi>d' Eſtrees</hi> ſhould come to lead a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious Life, reſolv'd to marry her, to free himſelf from the trouble of keeping a watch
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53606:126"/> upon her Actions; and for a Husband, he made choice of <hi>Nicholas Damarſal,</hi> Lord of <hi>Liancourt,</hi> a Gentleman of an Illuſtrious deſcent, and who had a great Eſtate, but whoſe mind and diſpoſition were as crooked as his Body. Madam <hi>d' Eſtrees</hi> was well inform'd of all his defects, however ſhe conſented to the marriage, to free her ſelf from the Tyranny of her Father, upon the King's word, that he would never permit the Marriage to be conſummated. But the King being engag'd in an Enterprize which held him longer then he expected, could not be preſent at the Nuptials. The new marry'd Lady perceiving the fatal hour approach, wherein ſhe was to be deliver'd to the Monſter which her Father had made choice of for her Husband, and no Galaunt appearing to reſcue her from the danger to which ſhe was juſt ready to be expos'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after ſhe had ſtorm'd a hundr'd times againſt his negligence, and ſworn as many times to be reveng'd of him ſhe prepar'd her ſelf to bear the brunt with all the vigour ſhe was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to ſhew. And finding ſhe was to expect no other aſſiſtance but what her own reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on afforded her, ſhe ſo well oppos'd her own reluctancy to the importunities of her Husband, that he could not engage her to go to bed with him that night. The next day he carry'd her home, in hopes he might more eaſily overcome her obſtinacy, in a place where he was abſolute Maſter. But ſhe took along with her all her kindred that had been invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

But alas! the King without taking any notice of him, ſet forward in order to the Seige of <hi>Chartres.</hi> Madam <hi>de Liancourt</hi> went along with him, accompani d by her Siſter, and one of her kinſwomen. Tho Siege was long; which gave the King an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to ſend for <hi>Elizabeth Babou</hi> to the Camp. She was the Wife of <hi>Francis de Eſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleau,</hi> Marquiſs of <hi>Sourdis,</hi> and Aunt to <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briella d' Eſtrees;</hi> and the King was reſolv'd to make uſe of her to be her Neices Governeſs. To very good purpoſe as it fell out: For the Marchioneſs who was greatly experienc'd in Amorous Affairs, gave her Neice ſuch good inſtruction, that ſhe became miſtreſs of all the Kings Affections by her Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, and obtain'd for the Marquiſs of <hi>Sour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> the Government of <hi>Chartres,</hi> after the place was taken.</p>

But the King's Amour delay'd the concluſion of this affair, as being afraid leaſt when he was at liberty, his Subjects ſhould preſs him to Marry her; which he could not find in his heart to do, in regard it was not lawful for him, becauſe ſhe had a Husband. Under theſe circumſtances, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it impoſſible for him to have a Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, he bethought himſelf of maraying Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>Catherine</hi> his Siſter with a Prince of the Blood. With this deſign he ſent for her to come to him; and going as far as the <hi>Loire</hi> to meet her, He preſented the Duke of <hi>Montpenſier</hi> to kiſs her hand, whom he deſign'd her for a Husband. The Princeſs gave him but a very cold reception, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were that ſhe did not like his perſon, or that having already ſurrender'd her heart to the Count of <hi>Soiſſons,</hi> ſhe could not find room in her breaſt for another. She arriv'd at <hi>Dieppe,</hi> where ſhe met with Madam <hi>Gabriella</hi> (for ſo was <hi>Mademoiſelle d Eſtrees</hi> call'd after her Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age) and the more ſhe found her worthy of the Love which her Brother ſhew'd her, the more ſhe hated her. She beheld her being in Favour with Envy, and to humble her, treated her with ſo much ſcorn and loftineſs, that had it been any other perſon, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:53606:128"/> could never have bore it. However Madam <hi>Gabriella</hi> complain'd of her contempt to the King, and beſought him to part 'em. But all that the King could do to ſatisfie his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, without diſobliging his Siſter, was to carry Madam <hi>Gabriella</hi> along with him where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he march'd to compleat the Conqueſt of his Kingdom, and to leave his Siſter at <hi>Dieppe</hi> Madam <hi>Gabriella,</hi> who ſeldom or never ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the King, began to inform her ſelf in the management of Publick Affairs, by the advice of Madam <hi>de Sourdis,</hi> and ſhew d ſo quick a Penetration and Judgment in matters of the higheſt importance, that ſhe procured to her ſelf an entrance into the King's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels. Nor did the Chancellor <hi>Chinconi</hi> contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute a little to procure her that favour. He had conceiv'd a moſt violent Paſſion for her, nor could he refrain from letting her underſtand it, notwithſtanding the gravity which the dignity of his Office exacted from him; but doing himſelf that juſtice, as to be convinc'd that there was no ſuch Charms in his Perſon that could engage Madam <hi>Gabriella</hi> to endure his Courtſhip, he had recourſe to other means, and made himſelf uſeful to her, in giving her opportunities to ſatisfie her Ambition.</p>
                  <p>But her extraordinary joy to ſee her ſelf mounted to ſuch a high degree of honour was ſomewhat allai'd, by the news which ſhe receiv'd of her Mothers death, who was maſſaker'd at <hi>Iſſoire</hi> in <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53606:128"/> that mutini'd againſt her Lover the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſs <hi>d' Allegre.</hi> But ſhe endeavour'd to repair that loſs by her Correſpondence with <hi>Belle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,</hi> whom ſhe met in Private, yet ſo wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the King could never tax her of infidelity, tho he had frequent jealouſies, which ſhe made a ſhift to diſſipate with her Careſſes, and her Proteſtations of being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible to any but himſelf. Nevertheleſs, Fortune found away to diſcover this miſtery, notwithſtanding all the Precautions which thoſe two Lovers took to avoi'd ſurpriſal. The King having lain with Madam <hi>Gabriella</hi> one night, roſe very early the next morning to execute ſome enterprize that he had in his thoughts, and left his Miſtreſs a bed, where ſhe lay under pretence of ſome little Indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; while <hi>Bellegard</hi> the better to conceal his Game, gave out that he was return'd to <hi>Mante.</hi> But ſo ſoon as the King was gone, <hi>Arphure,</hi> a Confident of Madam <hi>Gabriella's,</hi> commonly call'd <hi>la Rouſe,</hi> introduc'd the Duke into a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet, of which ſhe her ſelf had only the Key, and let him out again, ſo ſoon as her Miſtreſs was rid of all ſuch perſons as were any way ſuſpected to her. But while theſe two Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers were taſting all the Pleaſures, that a tender Paſſion could afford 'em, dreaming of no diſaſter, the King who miſt his deſign return'd, and by his haſty return put 'em into a ſtrange Confuſſion. However a bad ſhift was better then none; <hi>Arphure</hi> preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſlipt the Duke into her Cabinet, where ſhe
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53606:129"/> hid him at firſt, the Door of which was next the Bedſide, and the Window lookt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Garden. The King had a mind to eat ſome Sweetmeats, and knowing that <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phure</hi> kept her Miſtreſſes junkets in that Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, he call'd for the Key. Madam <hi>Gabriella</hi> made anſwer that <hi>la Rouſſe</hi> had it in her Pocket, and that ſhe was gone to viſit a kinſwoman of hers in the Town. Upon that, the King whoſe ſuſpitions were but the more exaſperated by ſuch a refuſal, threatend to break open the door and was going to work, tho ſhe complain'd that the noiſe would offend her Head. But the King who was reſolv'd to be ſatisfi'd of his doubts, made as if he had not heard what Madam <hi>Gabriella</hi> ſaid, and laid on with his Foot againſt the Dore, that <hi>Bellegard</hi> finding he ſhould be forc'd in his Sanctuary, thought it became him to venture Body and Soul to get out of the Bryars; and therefore opening the Window out he got, and jump'd into the Garden, tho he thought it a little to dear to buy his Pleaſure at the price of ſuch Catts leaps. But fortune happen'd to favour him ſo far that he got no harm by the fall; whether it were that the Ground were moiſt and yielding, or that this fear had diſpos'd his body for the danger. <hi>Arphure,</hi> who ſtood Sentinal to ſee what would become of the buſineſs, no ſooner beheld the Jump and the fair Eſcape, but in ſhe comes, ſweating and wiping her face with her Handkercher, and crying Lord, Madam, I never dreamt you would have had any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53606:129"/> for me. With that the Crafty Confident open'd the Cloſet, and gave the King what Sweetmeats he deſir'd. But then ſurpriz'd to find no body in the Cloſet, he concluded that <hi>Bellegard</hi> was become inviſible, while Madam <hi>Gabriella</hi> embolden'd by his aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, lay reproaching him, and deriding his jealouſie at ſuch a rate, that ſhe made an abſolute triumph of it. She told him, that ſurely his love began to coole, and that he only ſought a pretence to be rid of her, but that ſhe would not give him the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of quitting her firſt; for that ſhe would e'en prove an honeſt Wife at length, and go home to her Husband. The King ſcar'd with theſe menaces, threw himſelf at her feet, begg'd her Pardon a thouſand time, and promis'd never to have an ill thought of her more. Nor durſt he for a long time after ſhew the leaſt mark of Jealoſie, for fear ſhe ſhould in earneſt take a whimſey ſo contrary to his Repoſe.</p>
                  <p>While the Court was in this poſture, the Dutcheſs of <hi>Guiſe</hi> who ſtay'd at <hi>Paris</hi> with the Heads of the League, ſent to deſire a Paſport of the King, to go to one of her Houſes in the Country, which the King granted freely, and alſo gave her leave to paſs through the Town where he lay, <hi>Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle de Guiſe</hi> was glad of the Journey, not ſo much out of Curioſity, an Infirmity natural to perſons of her Sex, as to ſatifie two oppoſite Paſſions. She lov'd <hi>Bellegard,</hi> and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53606:130"/> hated Madam <hi>Gabriella,</hi> becauſe he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd by her. She had a mind to the one, in hopes to reingage him, and obſerve the other, in hopes to find out ſome way to be reveng'd of her. But for the better underſtanding of this intreague, we muſt go a little backward for the beginning of this Story.</p>
                  <p>While <hi>Paris</hi> was Beſeig'd by the King's Army, there were frequent Truces, during which all the Courtly Cavaliers met by the ſides of the Trenches, to diſcourſe and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Ladies, who to that purpoſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd upon the Ramparts. <hi>Annas d' Anglurre,</hi> Lord of <hi>Giury</hi> who was in love with <hi>Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle de Guiſe,</hi> ſtill made her acquainted with it, or elſe did her ſome other Civility. But ſhe never return'd him any favourable an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, becauſe ſhe had ſome pretentions to the King's heart, who had deſir'd her Picture, and teſtifi'd an inclination to marry her, provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Marriage would engage the Heads of the League to return to their obedience. Theſe hopes of a Crown made her deſpiſe all thoſe that durſt declare themſelves her Lovers. But ſhe could not always keep in that haughty mind. One day <hi>Bellegard</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering himſelf to be haul'd a long by ſome of his Friends to one of the moſt convenient Poſts for converſing with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53606:130"/> of it, and therefore explaining his ſtaring upon her to her advantage, made no queſtion of an abſolute Victory over the Dukes Heart. She examin'd him afterwards her ſelf, and finding him a perſon worthy to be belov'd, ſhe thought it might not be Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for her to comfort her ſelf for the loſs of thoſe grandeurs to which ſhe had aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, provided ſhe might ſpend the reſt of her days with perſon for whom ſhe had already ſo great an inclination. <hi>Bellegard</hi> had been accus'd to have contributed former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>y to the death the of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> who was murder'd at <hi>Blois,</hi> and Madam <hi>de Guiſe,</hi> who had been inform'd of it, repreſented <hi>Bellegard</hi> to her ſelf as a perſon whom it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hov d her to hate: but the more ſhe incens'd her heart to hate him, the leſs ſhe found it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to obey her, but with a ſtrange con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion found that her ſentiments for him were quite of another ſort. Thus Mother and Daughter fell both in love with a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whom a thouſand reaſons ſupported by decency and point of honour, oblig'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt. <hi>Mademiſelle de Guiſe</hi> well underſtood that her Mother was her Rivaleſs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to combat her growing paſſion, or at leaſt to conceal the diſorder it had made in her Breaſt. <hi>Bellegard</hi> on the other ſide, thought it behov'd him to extinguiſh thoſe thoughts of tenderneſs which he felt budding in his heart for <hi>Mademiſelle de Guiſe,</hi> or at leaſt to make as if he knew nothing of any ſuch
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53606:131"/> thing, for fear leaſt Madam <hi>Gabriella,</hi> who had been the principal ſupport of his fortune, ſhould go about to ruin him, when ſhe came to underſtand his unconſtancy.</p>
                  <p>He knew that Princeſs had been inform<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Thoſe excuſes were ſo well receiv'd that the Dutcheſs declar'd to thoſe that ſpoke in his behalf, that ſhe never gave Credit to thoſe Calumnies, and forbid her Daughter to accuſe the Duke, for the future, of being concern'd in her Fathers death. Nor did <hi>Mademoiſelle de Guiſe</hi> ſhew the leaſt reluctancy to obey ſo pleaſing a command: ſo agreeable to reaſon, and experience is the Proverb, that Love juſtifies all things.</p>
                  <p>The Dutcheſſes civilities put <hi>Billegard</hi> to a new non plus; he call'd to mind how <hi>Mademoiſelle de Guiſe</hi> had anſwer'd his paſſionate looks, and judg d that it would not be impoſſible for him to be belov d by her. On the other ſide, he laid before himſelf what a fowl piece of ingratitude it would be, to fail in his Fidelity, to a Perſon that prefer'd him before a King, greater for his vertue then for the Throne to which his birth had advanc'd him. Nevertheleſs, tho Reaſon, Ambition
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53606:131"/> and Honour condemn'd his change, he could not find in his heart to extingiſh a Paſſion ſupported by ſuch pleaſing hopes: nor would he renounce either the one or the other of his Miſtreſſes, but took a reſolution to ſerve 'em both at the ſame time. With this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign he thought it behov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d obliging anſwers. The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> having made his eſcape out of Priſon, where he had been confin'd ſince the death of his Father, <hi>Bellegard,</hi> who knew it particularly, ſent away a Trumpeter to congratulate him, and withal gave him two Letters to deliver to both the Princeſſes. The Trumpeter who underſtood his buſineſs, ſlipt into <hi>Mademoiſelle de Guiſes</hi> hand the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that was directed to her, unperceiv'd by any body. And ſhe, becauſe ſhe could not ſpeak to the Meſſenger, as being too ſtrictly obſerv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:53606:132"/> perſwaded the King to ſend ſome body to meet her, and obtain'd that permiſſion him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. I ſhall ſay nothing of what paſs'd at that enterview: But 'tis eaſie to gueſs that the Mother let ſlip no favourable opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, to give the Duke a full underſtanding of her Paſſion, and that the Daughter an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd the Duke's more paſſionate looks with glances no leſs tender, tho her modeſty ſomewhat ecclips'd the vivacity of 'em. When the Dutcheſs arriv'd at Court, ſhe could not forbear praiſing Madam <hi>Gabriella's</hi> Beauty; but the Princeſs tho ſhe agreed in her thoughts to every thing her Mother ſaid, could not find in her heart to applaud thoſe Charms that diſputed with her the poſſeſſion of an Affection to which ſhe had ſuch great Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. On the otherſide, Madam <hi>Gabriella,</hi> after ſhe had caſt her eyes ſometimes upon <hi>Bellegard,</hi> ſometimes upon <hi>Mademoiſelle de Guiſe,</hi> felt in her ſelf a kind of ſecret vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to find the Princeſs ſo lovely. So that the two Rivaleſſes ſhew'd as much cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs one for the other as it was poſſible for 'em to expreſs, without failing in thoſe Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities which it behov'd 'em to pay each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mutually, to avoid rudeneſs. More then that, <hi>Mademoiſelle de Guiſe,</hi> being in the Circle toward Evening, told <hi>Bellegard,</hi> whom ſhe perceiv d attending her Chair, after ſhe had ſometime conſider'd Madam <hi>Gabriella,</hi> that ſhe did not believe her ſo Beautiful as Fame had publiſh'd her. To which the Duke
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53606:132"/> durſt return no anſwer, for fear of being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard by his former Miſtreſs, who was not far from him.</p>
                  <p>The King who was inform'd of the love which the Dutcheſs of <hi>Guiſe</hi> had for <hi>Belle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,</hi> readily apprehended, that if he had any complaiſance for her, 'twas only for fear leaſt ſhe ſhould perceive the Paſſion which he had for her Daughter. And this judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which the King made of his Amours prov d two ways to the Dukes advantage. For it diſſipated the jealous ſentiments which the King had of Madam <hi>Gabriella,</hi> for whom he had a greater kindneſs then ever; and it made him utterly renounce his deſign of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying <hi>Mademoiſelle de Guiſe.</hi> So that <hi>Bellegard</hi> was at liberty to continue unmoleſted in his Intreague with both his Miſtreſſes.</p>
                  <p>He would have been too happy, could he but have cur'd Madam <hi>Gabriella</hi> of her jealouſie as well the King. But ſhe was too quickſight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and had too much intereſt to pry into his Conduct, to be ſo eaſily deceiv'd. She was ſoon ſenſible of the Services which he paid to <hi>Mademoiſselle de Guiſe,</hi> and the diſguſt ſhe took would not permit her to taſte the Pleaſure which the King's credulity would otherwiſe have afforded her, if her thoughts had been more at liberty. <hi>Mademoiſelle de Guiſe</hi> obſev'd in her turn the reſtleſſneſs of Madam <hi>Gabriella,</hi> and whither it were that ſhe thought by augumenting it, to oblige her to an abſolute Repture with <hi>Bellegard,</hi> or
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53606:133"/> that out of meer vanity ſhe took delight to make known the Power of her Charms, ſhe no longer kept her ſelf within Bounds, but affected, before her Rivalleſſees face, to give the Duke all the marks of affection that could fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment her Jealouſie. 'Tis true, that ſhe thought ſhe did her no unjuſtice in depriving her of the Duke, ſince ſhe had taken the King's heart from her. Nevertheleſs, things were not equal: For it is certain that Madam <hi>Gabriella</hi> would have renounc'd, with little trouble, all the intereſts of Fortune, provided ſhe might have met with her ſatisfaction in point of Love.</p>
                  <p>The Dutcheſs of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> after ſhe had ſtay'd a day at Court, and obtain'd a Neutrality for the Houſe where ſhe deſir'd to ſpend the Summer, took her leave of his Majeſty. But Madam <hi>Gabriella</hi> could not pardon her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for the attempt ſhe made upon her Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Heart: ſo that ſhe would not ſee either the one or the other at their departure, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of being indiſpos'd. <hi>Bellegard,</hi> and the Chiefeſt part of the Grandees of the Court, attended her a great way, nor did they return till next morning. Madam <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briella</hi> gave the Duke a very cold reception, which did not a little perplex him: for he knew well, that it would be a difficult thing to enter into ſo ſtrict a Correſpondence with <hi>Mademoiſelle de Guiſe,</hi> ſo long as the War continu d: and that conſideration made him fear the loſs of his former Miſtreſs, the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53606:133"/> of whoſe company would make him ſome amends for the abſence of his new Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs. He upbraided himſelf with his own indiſcretion, and he had ſometimes the lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to repent of his being unfaithful to lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle purpoſe. But if <hi>Bellegard</hi> felt a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt in his Breaſt, the Dutcheſs of <hi>Guiſe</hi> enjoy'd as little Tranquility: She could not live remote from him who took up all her thoughts; and therefore, to remove all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles that kept her from his Company, ſhe perſwaded her Son to treat with the King; of which ſhe gave advice to the King by a Courrier ſent on purpoſe. <hi>Hen.</hi> IV. who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſierd nothing ſo much as to bring back his Subjects to their Duty by acts of Mildneſs, eſpecially this young Prince, for whom he had a value, and whom he knew to have a great intereſt among the <hi>Leaguers,</hi> accepted the Propoſal, and made choice of <hi>Bellegard</hi> to negotiate with the Dutcheſs. Of which Madam <hi>Gabriella</hi> having notice, ſhe endeavour'd to get another appointed in his Room, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting to the King, that the Duke was a young man without experience, who would never be able to carry on ſuch an Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; beſides, that his Mediation would not be ſo pleaſing to the Son as to the Mother. On the other ſide, <hi>Bellegard,</hi> who paſſionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſir'd to ſee his new Miſtreſs <hi>Mademoiſelle de Guiſe,</hi> made uſe of all his Credit with the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53606:134"/> Nor did the Duke ſtand in need of much Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to perſwade the King to it: for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regard the King well knew that Madam <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briella</hi> acted upon the account of jealouſie, the ſame Paſſion hinder'd him from yielding to her Reaſons.</p>
                  <p>Well at length the Duke ſet forward; but his Journey prov'd not ſo ſucceſsful as he promis'd to himſelf. For <hi>Paris</hi> being return'd to her obedience, the King, who ſaw the Leagures Party utterly ruin'd refus'd to grant the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> thoſe Conditions which he demanded. However <hi>Bellegarde</hi> would not be diſcourag'd, and being well ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by the Duke of <hi>Nevers,</hi> he oblig d the King to grant the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> a very advantagious accommodation. Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concluded, the Duke came to kiſs the King's hand at <hi>Mante,</hi> and was graciouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>1596. Madam <hi>Gabriella</hi> finding that <hi>Belle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde</hi> had made an accomodation for the Duke, would needs make another for the Duke of <hi>Main,</hi> in h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

To that purpoſe ſhe caus'd an offer to be made him of her Service; and he promis'd to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd all the Credit of the League to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance her to the Throne. The firſt thing ſhe
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53606:134"/> did, was the obtaining leave for the Duke to retire to <hi>Chalon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And becauſe that in order to bring it to paſs, there was a neceſſity of breaking the Contract which the King had made with Queen <hi>Margaret,</hi> ſhe endeavour d to gain the Conſent of that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. But they who ſpoke to her about it, found her no way diſpos'd to give her conſent, tho for no other reaſon, but that ſhe could not brook without diſdain, to ſee that room which they would perſwade her to quit, ſupply'd by a perſon ſo much her Inferiour. But tho the Marchioneſs of <hi>Beaufort</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to her ſorrow the ill ſucceſs of that Negotiation, the new importunities of the Duke of <hi>Bellegarde</hi> made her amends for it, who felt his almoſt extinguiſh'd. Fires rekindle'd
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53606:135"/> by that augmentation of her Grandeur. He took care to juſtifie himſelf, and was favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably heard; becauſe people readily believe whatever they deſire.</p>
                  <p>Tho <hi>Bellegarde</hi> had made his peace with the Marchioneſs, he no leſs aſſiduouſly pay'd his ſervices to <hi>Madamoiſelle de Guiſe,</hi> and made her ſuch frequent Viſits, that her Brother be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to take it amiſs. But all this while that he blam'd the Duke's Temerity, he committed the ſame error in reference to Madame, and ſpoke of him after ſo a diſobliging a manner, that <hi>Bellegarde</hi> believing himſelf oblig'd to reſent it, labour'd to remove him from the Court. To that purpoſe, he gave the King to underſtand by the Duke of <hi>Nevers,</hi> that the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi>'s Courting his Siſter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Permiſſion, was a wounding of his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and that it would be convenient to Baniſh him into ſome remote Province, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of ſome Honourable Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It ſo fell out alſo, that the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Province</hi> was then vacant, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Marchioneſs of <hi>Beaufort</hi> begg'd it for him. Nor could the King refuſe ſuch a Boon to his Favourite and Miſtreſs. So that the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> had the Government con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered upon him before he was aware, and was conſtrain'd to depart, without having time hardly to take his leave of Madame.</p>
                  <p>She, poor Princeſs, was ſtrangely ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>z'd when ſhe heard that her Lover was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd from her, without any hopes of ſeeing
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53606:135"/> him in a long time, in ſo much that ſhe had not the power to bid him adieu. However ſhe endeavour'd to find out who had drawn this misfortune upon her, but not being able to diſcover any thing, after ſhe had ſtorm'd for ſome days againſt her evil deſtiny, ſhe ſuffer'd amends to be made her for that loſs by <hi>John Lewis de Nogaret de la Valette,</hi> Duke of <hi>Eſpernon,</hi> and tho he were neither ſo hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome nor ſo young as the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> ſhe kept a good Correſpondence with him till her Marriage with the Duke of <hi>Barr,</hi> with Whom ſhe went to live in his own Territories, and by her departure deliver'd the Marchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneſs of <hi>Beaufort</hi> from a world of vexation, for being forc'd to pay many times ill receiv'd deferences to the Birth and Quality, rather then to the perſon of that Princeſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bellegarde</hi> on the other ſide, knew how to make the beſt advantage of the Marchineſs of <hi>Beauforts</hi> good. Humour, upon the departure of the Dutcheſs of <hi>Barr,</hi> to diſpoſe her to a reconciliation with <hi>Mademoiſelle de Guiſe;</hi> he alſo wrought her to conſent that he ſhould marry that Princeſs, as being the only means to cure the King's Jealouſie which began to revive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain more and more every day. On the other ſide Madam <hi>de Guiſe</hi> put it forward as much as lay in her power, knowing the advantage of ſuch a Match, at a time when the Marchioneſs of <hi>Beaufort</hi> diſpos'd of all the King's Favours. From that time forward therefore thoſe two Ladys perfectly underſtood one another, were
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:53606:136"/> never a ſunder, and affected the ſame Habits and the ſame Dreſſes. Which reconciliation deceiv'd the King to that degree, that he no longer ſuſpected <hi>Bellegarde</hi> to have any familiarity with the Marchioneſs, and he had been the Lord knows how long wrapt up in that error, but for an unexpected acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that awaken'd all his ſuſpitions at once. For <hi>Bellegarde</hi> one evening had written a very tender Billet to the Marchioneſs, which <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phure</hi> forgot under her Toylet, not having taken care to lock it up, by reaſon of ſome little indiſpoſition of her Miſtreſs. Now it ſo fell out that <hi>Peter. Beringhon,</hi> Firſt <hi>Valet de Chambre</hi> to the King, going betimes in the morning by the King's order, to know how the Marchioneſs did, perceiv'd the fatal Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, took it up, and carri'd it to his Maſter. Upon that, the King commanded him to keep a vigilant watch upon thoſe two Lovers, and <hi>Beringhon</hi> was ſo faithfull in the diſcharge of his Truſt, that ſeeing the Duke one Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enter the Marchioneſſes Chamber, he gave the King notice of it, who preſently command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Charles de Choiſul</hi> Marquis of <hi>Pralin,</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Guards of his Body, to go and Stabb that inſolent Fellow in his Miſtreſſes Arms.</p>
                  <p>The Marquiſs was at his wits end to be charg'd with an order ſo rigorous againſt two Perſons that had oblig'd him upon ſeveral occaſions. However he obey'd, and paſſing through the Guard-hall, made a ſign to five
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53606:136"/> or ſix to follow him; but he went ſo far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout and made ſuch a noiſe, that when he came into the Chamber he found no body but the Marchioneſs alone, to whom he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded his Commiſſion. The Marchioneſs took ſo kindly the Service he had done her, that ſhe promis'd him never to forget it. And it was upon her recommendation and <hi>Mademoiſelle de Guiſes</hi> together, who was no leſs concern'd in the preſervation of <hi>Belle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde,</hi> then the Marchioneſs, that <hi>Pralin</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd the Battoon of Marſhall of <hi>France;</hi> and afterwards they wrought him ſo deeply in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the King's favour, as thereby to raiſe him to that high degree of Fortune where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he appear'd toward the end of <hi>Henry</hi> the Greats Raign. In the mean time the Marchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneſs upbraided the King with his unjuſt ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitions; nor had the King any thing elſe to ſupport the Tranſports of his Indignation, then the Letter that <hi>Beringhon</hi> brought him. But as to that, ſhe ſwore that ſhe never read it, and eaſily juſtifi'd herſelf, becauſe ſhe had a Plenipotentiary Power to make her Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous Lover believe whatever ſhe pleas'd to impoſe upon him. So that there wanted nothing to compleat the Cure of the King's jealouſie, but her conſent to <hi>Bellegarde</hi>'s Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, who receiv'd an Order to depart the Court, and not to return, till he was married, and brought his Wife along with The Duke departed, and becauſe it was impoſſible to ſtay long from the Manſion of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53606:137"/> Pleaſure, he marri'd <hi>Ann de Beuil,</hi> the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Honore de Beuil,</hi> Siſter to <hi>Fontaine,</hi> who was ſlain at the Siege of <hi>St. Malo</hi>'s when that City declar'd for the League. With her, he return'd to <hi>Paris;</hi> but there he found a new Beauty, who never before had appear'd at Court; this was <hi>Louiſe de Budo</hi>'s, Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>James de Budoſs,</hi> and <hi>Katherine de Clare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> marry'd but a little while to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable <hi>Montmorency.</hi> This young Lady made all that pretended to be ſucceſsful in Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try tremble: and not without reaſon, for that there never was any Lover whoſe Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity could be proof againſt her Charms. But ſhe was ſo haughty withall, that ſhe ſcorn'd the love of the one and the jealouſies of the other.</p>
                  <p>Nor could the King defend himſelf any bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then his Courtiers defended themſelves from the ſparkling Glances which ſhe darted from her eyes, but was very officious in pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his aſſiduities to her, never valuing the trouble it might be to Madam <hi>de Beaufort.</hi> The Counſtable alſo took delight in her di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbances, and jeaſted about 'em with <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal de Biron,</hi> who ſolely poſſeſs'd the Kings Inclinations. But Fortune ſoon after deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the Marchioneſs from ſo dangerouſs a Rivaleſs: for ſhe dy'd in Childbed, leaving the Conſtable two Children, <hi>Henry,</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Duke of <hi>Montmorancy,</hi> and <hi>Charlote Margarite,</hi> who was marri'd to <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon</hi> Prince of <hi>Condè,</hi> which was the occaſion
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:53606:137"/> of a very great Intreague, towards the end of this Raign. Madam <hi>de Beaufort</hi> had alſo by the King <hi>Katherine Henrietta,</hi> legitimated of <hi>France,</hi> whom in 1619, marry'd <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Lorrain</hi> Duke of <hi>Elbeuf,</hi> and <hi>Alexander de Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſme,</hi> commonly call'd the Grand Prior, who ended his days in the Dungeon of the Caſtle of <hi>Vincennes,</hi> where he had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd by the order of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. But the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs was not brought to bed of this Prince till after the Queen was unmarry'd; and then it was that finding her ſelf at liberty, ſhe made uſe of all her wit to oblige the King to ſet the Crown upon her Head. The King alſo, over whom ſhe had an abſolute aſcendant, left nothing omitted on his part to have gratifi'd her deſires, and baniſh'd <hi>Nicholas de Neuville,</hi> Lord of <hi>Villeroy,</hi> and Secretary of State, for preſuming with too much liberty to condemn his deſign. Now in regard the King was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to obtain whenever he pleas'd the conſent of Queen <hi>Margaret,</hi> there remain'd no more to do but only to get the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> to allow the Divorce. To which purpoſe he ſent with the Character of his extraordinary Embaſſador, <hi>Nicholas Brulard,</hi> Lord of <hi>Sileri,</hi> then Preſident of the Parliament, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Chancellor of <hi>France.</hi> He was one of the moſt able Miniſters the King had, and in regard he was no leſs Zealous for his Maſters Intereſts then for thoſe of the Marchioneſs, to whom he was beholding for a good part of his Fortune, 'twas to be preſum'd that he would
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53606:138"/> leave nothing uneffected to render his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſie ſucceſsful. But before we relate the ſucceſs of his Negotiation, it will not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs to ſhew upon what grounds the King demanded the Diſſolution of his marriage: which cannot be better underſtood then by the Manifeſto that he publiſh'd upon that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</p>

That Prince being naturally vain glorious, was ſo far from making a miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his good fortune, that there Intreague, after it had been the diſcourſe of the whole Court, was divulg'd in the Army, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from mouth to mouth, afforded ample matter of Raillery to all the Foot Souldiers, of which <hi>Martignes</hi> was Collonel.

                     <p>So soon as we were marry'd, they who had right to pretend to her familiarity, diſcarded themſelves, and oblig'd her by their withdrawing themſelves to ſtoop to Gallantries not ſo Illuſtrious. The Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs of <hi>Nevers</hi> her very good friend, who lov'd <hi>Cocona</hi>'s, engag'd her to favour <hi>la Molle</hi> a Confident of their Intreague, to ſpare him the trouble of holding the Cloak when they were together. But they preſerv'd not thoſe Lovers very long, for being found guilty of the Conſpiracy of the Marſhals
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:53606:140"/> 
                        <hi>Montmorency,</hi> and <hi>de Coſſe,</hi> they left their Heads upon a Scaffold. At what time theſe Compaſſionate Ladys, underſtanding that they lay expos'd to the view of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, took up the pretious remainders of the Objects of their Amours, and put 'em into their Coach: which done they carry'd 'em to St. <hi>Martins</hi> Chapel below <hi>Montmatre,</hi> where after they had bedew'd 'em with their Tears, they buried 'em with their own hands.</p>
                     <p>The Queen was ſo over preſs'd with grief for the Tragical end of <hi>la Molle,</hi> that ſhe was pitty'd by St. <hi>Hue.</hi> That Noble Knight was reſolv'd to make her amends for the loſs of him, and out of that Pious Intention, went often to viſit her, at <hi>Nerac</hi> in ſeveral diſguiſes; but finding her me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy return'd the very ſame day that ſhe ſaw herſelf depriv'd of his ſweet Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations, ſhe ſtood in need of <hi>Buſſy</hi> to chear her up. Nevertheleſs, ſhe did not find the latter fit for her turn, becauſe as tis ſaid he was a better Trencher-man then a Bedfel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and for that he was often tormented with a Colick, of which he had uſually a fit at the beginning of his ſport.</p>
                     <p>But the difference between thoſe two parties, did not hinder her from harkning to the Duke of <hi>Main,</hi> a good Champion, Plump and Fat, and Voluptuous like her ſelf. That conformity of humours
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53606:140"/> caus'd the correſpondence to laſt very long, notwithſtanding that Madam <hi>Vitry</hi> came in for a ſhare, and did all ſhe could to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt it. Nevertheleſs, the Duke forgot him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf one day, when he wrote to her Riva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, that he prefer'd the Sun before the Moon; that is to ſay in plain intelligible Language, Madam <hi>Vitry</hi> before the Queen of <hi>Navarr;</hi> becauſe my chaſt Spouſe call<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>This Sacrifice could not make <hi>Diana</hi> looſe her inconſtant Humour, nor was it juſt that ſhe ſhould continue her fidelity to a Man who ſeperated himſelf from her to make War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Party which Honour and Virtue oblig'd him to embrace. The <hi>Huguenots</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo would have had reaſon to complain, could ſhe have found no body among 'em worthy to enjoy her, for a few dayes at leaſt. Vicount <hi>Turenne</hi> was the firſt of their Hero's that enter'd the Liſts, he was Proper and had a good Preſence; and hiſ acceptable outſide pleaſed at firſt. But ſhe found him not ſo amiable in Private as in Public, ſo that ſhe diſmiſs'd him with this Character that he was like Empty Clouds that onely make a fair ſhow. This Lover in Diſpair would have gone and hang'd himſelf in ſome remote Country, and I know not what would have been become of him if for the Intereſt of our Party, I had not oblig'd her to recall him. She had much a do to find in her heart to be
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:53606:141"/> ſo good natur'd becauſe her Vanity had put her in hopes that the <hi>Vicount</hi> would have done like <hi>Anaxarete</hi>'s Lover, who hang'd himſelf up at her Dore. And it was a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to her, to ſee her ſelf depriv'd of the Honour to have forc'd a Man of his Merit to have hang'd himſelf for her Sake.</p>
                     <p>She made me pay dear for this Complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance; ſo that I was conſtrain'd to ſuffer that which ſhe had for <hi>Clermont d' Amboiſe,</hi> who embrac'd her often in her Night Gown upon the Threſhold of the Chamber-dore, while I to give her time to go to bed, either walk'd or play'd in my Parlor with ſuch Officers as I had about me. The Convenience could not be carry'd any farther; and I know more <hi>Coquetts</hi> then one that would have purchas'd at the price of any Gold a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of this Character. Nevertheleſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I would not be accus'd of venting my Morals ſo extraordinary, to tame the jealous, and take advantage of their weakneſs I will ſet forth the reaſons that induc'd me to obſerve this Conduct. I was a King without a Kingdom, and Head of a Party, which it behov'd me to maintain moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly without Men or Money to raiſe any: and when I ſaw the Tempeſt ready to poure upon me, had no other way to divert it, then by my ſubmiſſion. Then this good Lady, ſuch as ſhe is, was not unuſeful to me; the conſideration of her, mollifi'd her Mother and her Brothers exaſperated againſt
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:53606:141"/> me. On the other ſide, her Beauty drew to me a good number of ſtout Men, which her eaſineſs retain'd in my ſervice; and ſhe would have thought it an injury done to the intereſt of our Party, had ſhe diſcourag'd any one by the exceſs of her ſeverity. Judge you, after all this, if I had not reaſon to keep fair with her. However, there were ſome that were the ſubject of her railliery, and I had the honour to be entruſted with their ridiculous Paſſion. The old Fool <hi>de Pierat</hi> was one of that number; Love made him her Chancellor, and he conteſted for this Employment, that he might have the priviledge to write to her thoſe Letters which his tenderneſs dictated, and with which, that perfidious Officer and my ſelf divertis'd our ſelves when we were alone together. Thoſe who had erected her Scheme, had foretold, that her Stars threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that ſhe ſhould dye by my hand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the 21 and 28 of <hi>March</hi> 1580. and that I would ſacrifice her to my outrag'd Honour, but my prudence or the hopes of my future ſeparation, render'd that predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction vain, and fruſtrated the malignity of her Stars. We continu'd together as before, I in my Indulgence, and ſhe abandon'd over to her Voluptuouſneſs. She invented alſo new Ragoos, by laying on black Taffata Sheets upon her Bed, and lighting up a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Wax Candles in her Chamber. And then it was that ſhe became fruitful, and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:53606:142"/> brought to light that fruit of her Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiniſm, which being educated under a bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd name, promiſes one day to out do her Mother, in her happy talents. Theſe niceties and refinements of her wantonneſs had brought her to that delicate paſs, that ſhe could not endure me. When at any time I return'd from Hunting with my face all duſty, and bath'd in ſweat, lay down by her ſide, I was no ſooner out of the Bed, but ſhe caus'd the Sheets to be chang d, tho perhaps I had not lain there above a quarter of an hour. She did not only ſcorn my Perſon, but my Birth, which ſhe thought inferior to hers. One day, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving deſir'd her to let Madam <hi>de Thoiras,</hi> with whom I had ſomething of Affinity, ſit down at her Table, ſhe anſwer'd me, that then ſhe muſt waſh her feet in a Baſon full of Water, as if ſhe had been one of the poor Women, that come to have their feet waſh'd upon <hi>Maunday Thurſday.</hi> As if ſhe had not at <hi>Florence</hi> a hunder'd Merchants, that were nearer a kin to her by twenty degrees, then any of the Relations of the Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Families of <hi>Foix</hi> and <hi>Albret</hi> to the Houſe of <hi>Bourbon.</hi> But thoſe adventures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell her afterwards that humbl'd her Pride.</p>
                     <p>After ſhe had been ſhamefully expell d out of <hi>Paris,</hi> from whence a Captain of the Guards of the Body ſent her packing, and ſearch'd her very Litter, to ſee what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:53606:142"/> ſhe had, and whither <hi>Meſdames de Duras,</hi> and <hi>Bethune</hi> her Cabinet Secretaries, who were forbid to follow her, were there or no, ſhe was a little more cautious, for fear of worſe uſage. However, her reſerv'd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was but of a ſhort continuance, no longer then the remembrance of the affront: ſo ſoon as the Image of Pleaſure had ras'd it from her memory, ſhe was to be ſeen plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſelf in Voluptuouſneſs, with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridl'd Incontinency. She left me without ſo much as bidding me adieu, and went to <hi>Agen,</hi> a City contrary to my Party, there to keep her Amorus Court, and to continue her Debaucheries with more freedom. But the Inhabitants ſcandaliz'd at her looſe man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of living, ſent her packing in ſo much haſt, that ſhe had hardly time to get up behind one of her Favourites, and they that could not tell where to hire Horſes traps d after her, ſome without Maſques, ſome without Aprons, ſome not half dreſs'd, and in ſo great diſorder, that you would rather have taken 'em for Gypſies, then Maids of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to a Great Queen.</p>
                     <p>They were accompani'd by ſome Officers, ſome a Horſe-back without Boots, others a Foot, under the orders of <hi>Lignerac,</hi> who carri'd 'em to <hi>Carlat,</hi> in the Mountains of <hi>Anvergne,</hi> where <hi>Marcé</hi> his Brother was Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour; a Place of ſtrength indeed, but which you would have rather taken for a Cavern to harbour Thieves, then for the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:53606:143"/> Reſidence of a Princeſs, both the Daughter, Siſter and Wife of a King.</p>
                     <p>I bluſh when I think of all theſe Indignities; well knowing that Hiſtory will not fail of tranſmitting to Poſterity the actions of great Perſonages, notwithſtanding all the care they can take to ſtifle 'em. What a ſhame will it be, when after twenty Ages, an Age leſs vitious ſhall come to underſtand that this produc'd ſuch a Monſter of Uncleanneſs, and that there ſhould iſſue from a Blood ſo Noble, and Pure; a Woman whoſe diſſolutneſs ſurpaſs'd the Incontinency of <hi>Julia</hi> and <hi>Meſallina.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I was in hopes, before this laſt adventure, that her natural inconſtancy would have infus'd into her a diſguſt of a Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery wherein ſhe met with no oppoſition, ſeeing Our deſires are not exaſperated but by the obſtacles that oppoſe 'em; and that in recompence of that indulgence where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with We ſuffer'd all her Diſloialties, ſhe would at length have ſurceas'd to diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour me; but experience has ſhew'd me, that Vice being become habitual to her, ſhe never felt any remorce of Conſcience when ſhe betray'd her Duty. This obſtinacy of hers, in violating the Rights and Laws of Conjugal Society, made me at length re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to break the Bond that united us to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. God who has done me the Favour to deliver me from this laſcivious Woman, well knows how much I wiſh'd it had been
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:53606:143"/> in my power to have unfolded this ſecret Article of our Divorce in milder terms, and not to have been conſtrain'd to publiſh what ought to have been buri'd in eternal ſilence; but publick murmur and calumny force me to it, and the aſſurance I have of advancing nothing but what is known all over <hi>France</hi> invites me to it.</p>
                     <p>The King her Brother underſtanding her flight, and hearing the complaints which I made of her, wrote me word that if I would have taken his Counſel, and have treated his Siſter, as ſhe deſerv'd, I ſhould have been free from diſturbance, nor ſhould I have been tyr'd with her follies. He alſo openly ſpoke it at Dinner, that the Queen of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varr</hi> did not only proſtitute her ſelf to the Younger Brothers of <hi>Gaſcoine,</hi> but to the Mule Drivers and Tinkers of <hi>Auvergne:</hi> which words prov'd true. For after ſhe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd at <hi>Carlas,</hi> where ſhe ſtay'd a good while, not only without any Canopies or Beds of State, but without a Smock, ſhe made no diſtinction in the choice of her Favorites. She honour'd her Cook with her laſt favours, not being able to lie idle, while ſhe ſtayd for <hi>Duras,</hi> whom ſhe had ſent into <hi>Spain</hi> for Money, tho her Envoy's Wife preach'd Conſtancy and Loyalty to her every day, to prevent her fullying her ſelf with ſuch an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious Engagement. 'Tis true that all her other Lovers had forſaken her, when they ſaw her in miſery, and that St. <hi>Vincent</hi>
                        <pb n="54" facs="tcp:53606:144"/> was return'd home to avoid the exceſſive expence he muſt have been at, had he undertaken to have kept all her Family.</p>
                     <p>But the niceneſs of the Queen of <hi>Navarr,</hi> could not long comply with a Lover that always ſmelt of Greaſe, and therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe could not be without one, ſhe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc d into his room her Squire <hi>Aubiac,</hi> who could never elſe have expected with his read hair, and his freckl'd skin to have been admitted to the Embraces of a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>France.</hi> Nevertheleſs he had ſubject enough to ſatisfie his Vanity, being found a Bed with her by Madam <hi>de Marcé,</hi> who came a little to early, to pay her reſpects to the Queen. But that officious viſit was repaid with the death of her Husband, whom the Queen ſent into the other world, by help of a Beverage prepar'd <hi>alamode</hi> of her Mothers Country. She thought, that after ſhe had poyſon'd the Governour, that it might have been eaſie for her, with the help of the Souldiers that <hi>Roras, Aubiac</hi>'s kinſman was gone to raiſe in <hi>Gaſcoine,</hi> to have made her ſelf abſolute Miſtreſs of that Place, and to have expell'd thoſe that had ſo generouſly receiv'd her during her miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune. But ſhe faild in her wicked deſigns. <hi>Duras</hi> returning from <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſeeing an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Lover in poſſeſſion of his room, would not let her have any Money, but fain'd to have laid it out in Gloves, Parfumes, Horſes and other Curioſities of the Country from
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:53606:144"/> whence he came, what the new <hi>Amazon</hi> had deſign'd in order to make War againſt me. The <hi>Gaſcoine</hi> Levies were diſcover'd, the Gariſon was reinforc'd, and ſhe her ſelf was charitably advis'd to ſeek ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Poſt; which the fear of an Affront made her do with great precipitation. She departed with the ſame Equipage, and in the ſame diſorder as ſhe arriv'd, and made ſuch long days Journies, that ſhe got to <hi>Jury,</hi> a Houſe belonging to the Queen her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But ſhe had hardly time to alight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe ſaw her ſelf beſieg'd by the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſs of <hi>Cavillac,</hi> to whom the King had given ſuch Order. There ſhe was taken with her Paramour, who had hid himſelf under a heap of Ordure, without Beard or Hair; ſhe her ſelf having clipt 'em off, the better to diſguiſe him. Nevertheleſs, ſhe did not reſolve to ſave him this way, till ſhe had in vain attempted to infuſe Courage into him, and to have perſwaded him by death to have avoided that ignominy which was prepar'd for him, offring to ſhew him the way herſelf, provided he had but the reſolution to follow her. I make no queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but they who read this Manifeſto will be mov'd to compaſſion, when they ſhall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand to what extremities this Princeſs was reduc'd to; an unworthy Scien of thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Hero's that have ſo gloriouſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the Bounds of this Famous Kingdom, and humbl'd the Pride of her Neighbours.

There is no pleaſure in divining as he did; ſuch Oracles are to be dreaded; and I wonder that they who ſucceeded to his good Fortune never made any reflection upon it. Certainly they rely d upon the Proverb which ſays, that Gibets are for the Uunfortunate, not for the Guilty. <hi>Cavillac</hi> being rid of his Rival, whom he had ſacrific'd rather to his Jalou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, then to any Revenge, left nothing omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to pleaſe his new Miſtreſs.

Who could ever have ſuſpected the Daughter of one of the greateſt and wiſeſt King's upon the Earth to have been guilty of ſo much unworthineſs. Nevertheleſs of a Queen ſhe is become a

But tho' ſhe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves no meaſures in ſatisfying her inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate deſires, ſhe thinks to dazle the Eyes of the world by prophaneing the moſt Auguſt Miſtery of our Religion. Three times a Week ſhe approaches the Holy Table with Lipps as much adulterated as her Heart; with a Countenance daub'd with Black and Red, and her Neck lay'd bare down to her Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Her Dotage upon <hi>Pomeni</hi> was attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to ſome Charm, becauſe ſhe always wore between her Skin and her Shift, a Blew Silk Purſe hanging in a ſtring from her Neck, wherein was a Silver Box upon which ſeveral unknown Characters were Engrav'd. She opend it in the Preſence of ſome her Friends, who ſaw her own Picture at one end and the Tinker's at the other. She told them with Tears in her Eyes, that ſhe was never to open it but at ſuch certain Times, and to keep it till her death. Nor is this the firſt time that extraordinary things of which we can give no true Reaſon have been aſcrib'd to Supernatural Cauſes. The ſame thing is reported of the Dutcheſs of <hi>Valentinois,</hi> that ſhe was only beholding to <hi>Magick</hi> for the great Aſcendant which ſhe had over <hi>Henry.</hi> II. the Queen of <hi>Navarrs</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. No body knows it better then this Laſcivious Woman.</p>
                     <p>They who read theſe Heroick Actions of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:53606:148"/> Hers (for ſhe will never want Hiſtorians) will admire her obſtinacy in Vice, which neither Age, nor the abatement of her Charmes nor the Affronts which ſhe receiv'd could e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver vanquiſh. They will agree that ſo vertuous a Life ought to be enregiſter'd in the Temple of <hi>Paphos,</hi> to ſerve as a Model to thoſe who deſire to enrol themſelves in the Famous Corporation of the Daughters of <hi>Cyprus.</hi> 'Tis true, that ſome there were, who thinking ſhe had the Purſe and ſoul of a Queen, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated Books to her, and in their Panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries aſcrib'd thoſe Virtues to her which ſhe never had. But they had as good have let 'em alone, for long Tradition far more like to laſt from Father to Son for many Ages, will give 'em the lye and convince the world not only of their ſordid flattery, but their vile Impoſture; beſides the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach that they are like to undergo from thoſe that ſhall read their Writings after their Deceaſe. But which was worſe, they did but labour in vain in this Life, as being all of 'em fruſtrated of their great Hopes and Expectations: for that never any body boaſt of her Liberality, but all Men complain'd of her Ingratitude. Her moſt favour'd Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours were never enrich d with her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, and the Priſons are full of thoſe that ſhe has Ruind. She has been ſometimes ſeen to have been Prodigal of her Almes, but never willingly paid her Debts; ſhe had always ſo little reſpect for Religion that ſhe
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53606:148"/> never was at a Sermon but ſhe ſlept, at Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers but ſhe talk'd all the while, never at Maſs without a Paramour by her ſide. She gives away, to my coſt, the Tenths of her Rents and Penſions to the next Monaſteries, but ſhe detaines the Wages of her Servants and the price of the Goods which People truſt her with for the ſupport of her Houſe-keeping. She minds nothing but out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhew and Vanity, but in her heart ſhe has not the leaſt Sence either of Honour or Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety. I thought to have finiſh'd this Manifeſto with a Deſcription of her Inclinations; but <hi>Bajomon</hi> ſtops me, and enforces me to give him a daſh of my Pencil. This fellow the greateſt ſot that ever appear'd at Court was introduc d by Madam <hi>Danglure,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by Madam <hi>Roland,</hi> and <hi>Le Maire</hi> compleated the Poliſhing of him. This Man ſhe had made her Idol, tho' He had been cuft by <hi>de Lone,</hi> the Son of a Procter of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and ſhe had taken care of his fortune, to prevent his ending his days in an Hoſpital. I ſhall not enter any farther into the particulars of their Amours, there being nothing in 'em to be obſerv'd but what is baſe and below the honour of a Queen. It behoves me now to draw the Curtain, out of a remainder of value for her, and ſo end this Story, that I may not be tedious to the Reader. I ſhall only pray to God to touch their hearts, and ſhed down upon em his effectual Grace, without which they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

So ſoon as <hi>Mademoiſelle</hi> came to the Dutcheſs of <hi>Beauforts</hi> ſhe found her undreſſing herſelf, and complaining of a great Pain in her Head. But the Dutcheſs was no ſooner a bed, but ſhe was taken with a terrible Convulſion, from which ſhe recover'd by the help of Strong Remedies: and then it was that ſhe began a Letter to the King; 'tho ſhe could not finiſh it, being hinder'd by another Convulſion. When ſhe came to her ſelf again, a Letter was preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her from the King, but ſhe could not read it, being ſeiz'd by another Convulſion that held her ſo lohg as ſhe liv'd.

                  <p>Some there were who aſcrib'd the cauſe of her Death to another cauſe; and gave it outh that ſhe had made a Contract with the Devil to Marry the King, and that that ſame Enemy of Mankind had taken away her Life. They farther add as an Embelliſhment to ſet out the Fable that the Dutcheſs was acquainted long before with the Tragical end that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ended Her. For that being one day in the Garden of the <hi>Tuillerys,</hi> ſhe met with a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Magician who was telling ſeveral Ladies
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:53606:151"/> of the Court their Fortunes, at what time the Dutcheſs having a deſire to know what ſhould be ber Deſtiny, was very Importunate with the Magician, who excus'd himſelf for above an hour; telling her that conſidering the flouriſhing Fortune ſhe enjoy'd, ſhe could wiſh for nothing greater. But at length the Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs inſiſting to know at leaſt what end ſhe ſhe ſhould come to, the Magician bid her at her leiſure pull out her Porket-Lookinglaſs and there ſhe ſhould ſee the Object of her Curioſity. Upon which the Dutcheſs, when ſhe pul'd out her Mirror, ſaw the Devil, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king her by the Throate, which terrifi'd her to that degree, that ſhe ſounded away in the arms of one of her Women that attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her. The very ſame thing or very like it, is told of the Conſtable <hi>Montmorancy</hi>'s Lady, who dy'd but a little before after a very ſtrange manner. But People of Sence and Judgment gave no Credit to theſe Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
                  <p>The ſame day being <hi>Wedneſday, La Varenne</hi> came to tell the Marſhal <hi>d Ornano,</hi> who was hearing the Paſſion Sermon at St. <hi>Germains de, Lauxerrois,</hi> that the Dutcheſs was dead, and that it would be convenient to hinder or prevent the King's coming to <hi>Paris,</hi> whether he was juſt deſigning his Journey; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſir'd him to go and meet him, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to make him alter his Roade.

                  <p>So ſoon as the King ſaw the Marſhal, his heart miſgave him, that he knew already the Tidings which he came to tell him, and by his Lamentations and bitter Complaints ſoon made it appear, that Hero's have their fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings as well as other Men.

                  <p>When the King's Grief was a little allay'd, his Favorites who underſtood that the right way to diſſipate his Melancholy was to ſet before his Eyes ſome other Dazling Lady that might make him amends for the loſs of his Dutcheſs, engag'd him in a Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Match near <hi>Malherbe,</hi> a Caſtle belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Marquiſs <hi>d' Entragues.</hi> That Lord had two Daughters ſurpaſſingly Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, and Witty above the Common Rate, eſpecially the Eldeſt who was call'd <hi>Henri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etta de Balzack.</hi> Madam <hi>d' Entragues</hi> being acquainted with their Deſign to entangle the King with one of her Daughters, ſent to him to come and repoſe himſelf at her Houſe in his Return from Hunting. The King, who had heard much talk of <hi>Mademoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle d' Entragues</hi>'s Beauty, willingly fell into the Snare which was laid for his Liberty, and accepted the Marchioneſſe's Offer. He found the Eldeſt of her Daughters to be a Thouſand times handſomer then ſhe was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, and therefore not being able to quit her ſo ſoon, he remain'd for ſome days at <hi>Malherbe,</hi> with thoſe that were his chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Conſidents.

Nor did the Marquiſs think it ſufficient to have quarrel'd with the Count; he order'd his Horſes to be put in the Coach, and carry'd away his Daughters to <hi>Marcouſſis.</hi> The King being inform'd of it, rode poſt thither ſome few days after, faining to take that Rode in his way to <hi>Blois;</hi> now in regard his journey to <hi>Blois,</hi> was only a pretence to cover his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to <hi>Marcouſſis,</hi> the King ſtaid their but a very few days, and return d Poſt to <hi>Paris.</hi> He alitt at the Preſident <hi>Verdun's,</hi> where he call'd for a bed, but he was no ſooner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd to his Chamber, but <hi>Bourigueux,</hi> who lay in his Chamber, roſe and committed a thouſand extravagances: for the heat of the

                  <p>The Queen departed from <hi>Lyon,</hi> almoſt as ſoon as he, but ſhe travelle'd more ſlowly, and met by the way the Ladies that were to ſerve her in the imployments of her Houſhould. The Dutcheſs of <hi>Nenours</hi> was made Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendent, Madam <hi>de Guerckeville,</hi> Lady of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and Madam <hi>de Richlieu</hi> Lady Dreſſer. But the Queen would by no means permit the latter to do her duty, as having already deſign'd <hi>Eleanor Galigay</hi> for that Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who had ſerv'd her along time, and to whom ſhe had promis'd the Place, How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:53606:156"/> the buſineſs was to remain undetermin'd, till the King ſhould put an end to the diſpute, which however was no ſmall vexation to the Queen. But it caus'd a far grater Heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burning within her, when ſhe was conſtrain'd to ſend back into <hi>Italy</hi> all the Perſons that had accompanid her, ſo that the Ladys who were plac'd about her were ſoon ſenſible of the effects of her diſquieted humour. Upon which, <hi>Madermoiſelle de Guiſe,</hi> who had no kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for the Marchioneſs of <hi>Vernueil,</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to perſwade the Queen, that it was an effect of her Counſels, and pretended to ſhare ſo deeply in the Queens diſcontents, that ſhe inſinuated her ſelf by that means into her favour.</p>
                  <p>The King rode to meet the Queen as far as <hi>Nemours,</hi> changing Horſes threeſcore times. He carry'd her to <hi>Fontain Bleau,</hi> where after he had ſtai'd five or ſix days, he accompani'd her to <hi>Paris,</hi> where he lodg'd her in <hi>Gondy</hi> Houſe, becauſe the <hi>Loure</hi> was not then in a condition to receive her. The ſame day, the King commanded the Dutcheſs of <hi>Nemours</hi> to waite upon the Marchioneſs of <hi>Vernueil</hi> at her Lodgings, and preſent her to the Queen. Fain would that prudent Princeſs have excus'd her ſelf from ſuch an ungrateful Office, which was the only way to incur the loſs of her Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit with her Miſtreſs; but the King would be obey'd. Thereupon ſhe carried her to the Queen, who was ſurpriz'd to ſee her, and gave her but a very cold Reception. The Marchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneſs,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:53606:157"/> naturally confident, was no way daſht out of Countenance, but manag'd the Queen ſo many ways, that ſhe obligd her at length to ſpeak to her. Nevertheleſs, becauſe this viſit prov d not ſo ſucceſsful as the King ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, the King laid all the blame upon the Dutcheſs of <hi>Nemours,</hi> who was no leſs ſoure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lookt upon by the Queen. Which makes it manifeſt, that how prudently ſoever people may carry themſelves in Court-Intreagues, 'tis a difficult thing many times to prevent diſgraces.</p>
                  <p>But ſome days after, a favourable occaſion preſented it ſelf which ſurceas'd the exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that appear'd between the Queen and the King's Miſtreſs. <hi>Eleanor,</hi> who had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready made ſeveral fruitleſs efforts to get her ſelf confirm d in the Office of chief Dreſſer, which the Queen had beſtow'd upon her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs'd herſelf to the Marchioneſs, and by her means obtain'd what would never have been granted her by any other means.

Madam <hi>de Vennueil</hi> alſo was very unwilling to take the Office upon her, becauſe ſhe knew the averſion which the King had for both the perſons: Nevertheleſs, after <hi>Eleanor</hi> had beſought her, and had told her that the Queen would ſpeak to her about it, ſhe reſolv'd to bring the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to perfection. The Queen being inform'd of the aſſurances which the Marchioneſs had given <hi>Eleanor;</hi> return'd her a Thouſand Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities, and after that time ſhe never receiv'd any Preſent which ſhe did not ſhare with her, and treated her with that ſignal reſpect, that ſhe made no diſtinction betwen the Marchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and the reſt of the Princeſſes; which pleas'd the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> extreamly. Nevertheleſs, there was a neceſſity for deferring the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage till the Queen was brought to bed, who
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:53606:158"/> was deliver'd of a <hi>Dauphin,</hi> whoſe Birth was attended with that of the Marchioneſſes Son, who was <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> Duke of <hi>Vernueil,</hi> and dy'd within theſe few years. This en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement of the Kings Family was ſolomniz'd with ſeveral teſtimonies of Joy and exultation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Queen gave order for a grand Ball, which took up two or three months to practiſe it; and would needs have the Marchioneſs to dance an Entry, with which the King was ſo highly ſatifi d, that he caus'd the Marriage of <hi>Eleanor</hi> and <hi>Comini</hi> to be conſummated, and regald the new marri'd Couple with ſeveral magnificent Preſents. There was nothing minded but which way to divertiſe themſelves the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the Winter, and good part of the Summer: and the King was glad to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his Miſtreſſes content at any rate. But an accident happn'd that for ſome time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted the good correſpondence of thoſe two Lovers.</p>
                  <p>The King had ſome kind of inclination to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Dutcheſs of <hi>Villars,</hi> the Dutcheſs of <hi>Beaufonts</hi> Siſter; and tho there was nothing beautiful about her, but her Hair, accompani d with a certain luſture of Youth, yet ſhe thought the Power of her Charms ſufficient to make good for no ſmall time the Illuſtrious Conqueſt ſhe had made. But when ſhe ſaw that the King ſtuck cloſe to the Dutcheſs of <hi>Vernueil</hi> it begat within her a violent animoſity, that grew ſtill the more implacable as the Kings favour to her Rivaleſs increas'd. The

The Dutcheſs of <hi>Villars,</hi> therefore ſeeing her ſelf ſupported by the Queen, began to ſet her hand to the Plough. The Prince of <hi>Joyinville</hi> had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

However the Prince was not ſo faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to a perſon ſo amiable and ſo deſerving, but that he had caſt his eyes upon Madam <hi>de Vilkars,</hi> who taking the advantage of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, wheedl'd him in to deliver up the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of her Rivaleſs. So ſoon as ſhe had 'em in her Power, ſhe went and ſhew'd 'em to the Queen, who importun'd her extreamly to let the King ſee 'em. She made ſome ſcruple at firſt for fear of incurring the dipleaſure of ſo formidable an Enemy as the Marchioneſs of <hi>Vernueil.</hi> But the Queen preſt her ſo hard to a thing that her own intereſts ſufficiently prompted her to, that ſhe could notwithſtand her importunities.

                  <p>Madam <hi>de Villars,</hi> then being willing to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the Queens orders, ſought all opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to diſcourſe the King in private; and to that purpoſe, went to find him out at Church whither, he was gone to Maſs, under pretence of ſpeaking to him about ſome private concern After the ſacrifice was over ſhe told him ſhe had had ſomething of importance to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to him. Upon that every body withdrew, and then the Dutcheſs finding her ſelf alone with the King, deliver'd into his hands her Rivaleſſe's Letters. Adding withall, that as ſhe had receiv'd a thouſand favours from his Majeſty, and had always a great love for his Perſon, ſhe could not find in her heart to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal any longer the injury done him by her, whom of all Women in the World he had the moſt oblig'd, never conſidering how much his Heroick Vertues, his Birth and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Dignity had rais'd him above all other Men.</p>

Some days after, <hi>Bellegarde,</hi> having diſcover'd the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice which Madam <hi>de Villars</hi> had done the Marchioneſs of <hi>Vernueil,</hi> bent all his thoughts which way to ſalve the buſineſs; not ſo much out of any value for that Lady, or the Prince of <hi>Joyinville,</hi> for whom he had no kindneſs, but for the ſake of his Siſters intereſt; and thus he went about it.</p>

Madam <hi>de Villars</hi> was ſeparated from a Lover whom ſhe tenderly Lov d, and ſhamefully baniſh'd from the Court at a time that ſhe thought to have tryumph'd over her Rivaleſs.</p>
                  <p>During theſe Broyls, the Queens hatred of the Marchioneſs of <hi>Vernucil</hi> publickly brake out: for in regard ſhe thought ſhe had been utterly loſt in the Kings Affection, ſhe left nothing omitted to compleat her Ruin: nor could they ever from that time forward be reconcil'd again. The Marchioneſs did the Queen all the ill Offices ſhe could deviſe, and the Queen, who was inform'd of it, ſpair'd not in all places to manifeſt the Marks
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:53606:160"/> of her Reſentment, which divided the whole Court. On the Otherſide, the King tyr'd out with theſe Diſſentions, began to pay his Viſits again to <hi>Mademoiſelle de Bourdaiſtere,</hi> whith whom he had been formerly in Love; but he was ſoon a weary of her, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore marry d her to the Count <hi>d' Eſtampes.</hi> After that, he took to <hi>Jaqueline de Bueil,</hi> Counteſs of <hi>Moret,</hi> who had been bred up in the Princeſs of <hi>Conde</hi> s Houſe.</p>

And becauſe the Duke was forc d to ſtay at <hi>Rome</hi> about a Year, he had time to Cure himſelf of his Paſſion, and publickly declar'd at the return of the Dutcheſs, that he found her very much alter'd for the worſe.

                  <p>

What can a Man deny a Woman that he loves? <hi>Baſſompierre</hi> therefore betray'd his Maſter to gratifie his Miſtreſs, and deliverd into her hands the Letter which he had for Madam <hi>de Moret.</hi> The Marchioneſs after ſhe had read it, return'd it to him again,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:53606:162"/> and told him he might eaſily ſave himſelf from any trouble, by cauſing a Seal to be made like the King's, and ſo cloſing up the Letter as it was before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Baſſompierre</hi> follow'd her advice, and ſent his <hi>Valet de Chambre</hi> betimes next Morning to a Graver to make a new Seal. But as il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luck would have it, the Servant apply d him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the very ſame Workman who had made the King's. The Graver ſuſpecting there was ſome great Miſtery in the Buſineſs, took the Letter under pretence of examining the Impreſſion, and at the ſame time falling upon the Lad took him by the Collor, in order to ſtop him; but the Boy being too ſtrong for <hi>Turpin</hi> (that was the Gravers Name) reſcu'd himſelf out of his hands and leaving his Hat and Cloak behind him, ran away as faſt as his Legs could carry him, afraid he ſhould have been hang'd had he been taken. <hi>Baſſampierre</hi> order'd his <hi>Valet</hi> to be hid out of the way, and immediately haſtning too the Counteſs of <hi>Moret,</hi> told her that he had inadvertently open'd a Letter which he brought her from the King, miſtaking it for a Billet which he had receiv'd from a Lady; and therefore fearing to be accus'd either of deſign or Curioſity, he intended to have Seal'd it again with the imitation of the King's Signet, and then up, with the ſtory of <hi>Tarpin</hi> and his Servant; and deſir'd her to ſend to the Graver and demand the Letter.</p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:53606:163"/>
                  <p>The Counteſs never diving farther into the Matter, only laught at the Accident, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſent to <hi>Turpin</hi> for the King's Letter; but he ſent her word that he had parted from it, and deliver d it to the Preſident <hi>Seguier</hi> who was Preſident of the Criminal Court. Now in regard that neither the Counteſs nor <hi>Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumpierre</hi> could tell how to deal with the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in whom they had no Intereſt, and aſtern man beſides, they thought it convenient to, addreſs themſelves to Madam <hi>Lomenie,</hi> to the end that by her Credit ſhe might ſtiffle the buſineſs, either by getting the Letter out of the Preſidents Hands, or by obliging her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, who was then Secretary of State, to give ſuch an account of it to the King, as might excuſe the Marquiſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Baſſompierre,</hi> having taken his leave of the King, went to Madam <hi>de Lomenie,</hi> whom he found very buſie in preparing diſpatches for the Court.

The Marquiſs ſuſpecting that that ſame very Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter might relate to <hi>Turpin</hi>'s Adventure, ask'd her if there had happen'd any thing new and ſo urgent, that ſhe could not give him a Minuites time to ſpeak with her; to whom Madam <hi>de Lomenie</hi> made anſwer, that ſome body had been attempting to Counterfit the King's Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, but that by misfortune the Criminal had made his eſcape and that all that could be done was to ſecure the Letter which was

                  <p>Some days after the King went to St. <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains</hi> with the Queen, the Princeſs of <hi>Conti,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Montpenſier,</hi> and as they
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:53606:164"/> were croſſing the Water in the Ferry-Boat of <hi>Neuilli,</hi> the Coach overturn'd in the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. The King and the Duke eſcap'd drench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becauſe they leap'd in time out of the Boot, but the Ladys were in great danger of being Drown d. The Marchioneſs of <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueil,</hi> being inform'd of the accident, told the King by way of Raillery, the firſt time he came to Viſit her, that ſo ſoon as ſhe had ſeen the King's Perſon ſafe, ſhe would have cry'd out, <hi>The Queen Drinks.</hi> Which unlucky flowt being carry'd to the Queen, She was ſo incens'd at it, that in fifteen Days ſhe would not ſpeak to the King; ſo that there was much ado to reconcile 'em. After their reconciliation, there was a Ball pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos d, wherein the Queen was deſirous to be one of the Maſquers herſelf, but upon the King's Requeſt that the Marchioneſs might Dance amongſt the reſt, the Queen broke off the Match.</p>
                  <p>But the Friendſhip between the King and the Counteſs was not of long continuance; Her Intreague with the Prince of <hi>Joyinville,</hi> with which his Majeſty had been acquainted, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſet 'em at Variance; only when ſhe had nothing elſe to ſay for herſelf, ſhe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour d to excuſe it, by ſaying the Prince had promis'd her Marriage. Of which the King deſirous to be ſatisfy'd, ſent for the Dutcheſs of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and blaming the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence of her Son, threaten'd to puniſh him if he relaps'd into the ſame miſcarriage
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:53606:164"/> and if he did not repair the fault he had commited by marrying the Counteſs: ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding withal that he could well endure the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Miſtreſſe's ſought for in Marriage, but that he would not permit the covering of Criminal Intreagues under that Vaile, and that if he were any thing indulgent to the Prince of <hi>Joyinville,</hi> twas for love of her that was his Mother. But the Dutcheſs, naturally haughty, took amiſs the King's Civilities, and anſwer'd him in ſuch a manner as highly provoak'd him. In that ill humour he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Prince of <hi>Joyinville</hi> to be ſeiz'd; but he made his Eſcape upon notice that had been given him of the King's Anger. His Parents endeavour'd to pacifie. His Maieſty but they could obtain nothing more, but only that his raſh Miſcarriage ſhould be pardon'd, provided he departed the Kingdom, never to return again. Which Order he obey'd, nor was he recal'd from his Exile, till the next Reign.</p>
                  <p>And now the King to make himſelf amends for the Diſloyalty of the Counteſs of <hi>Moret,</hi> would needs knit an Intreague with the Dutcheſs of <hi>Montpenſier,</hi> who had been a Widow ſome few months. And becauſe ſhe was then in the Countrey, he order'd the Count of <hi>Cramail,</hi> her Neighbour, to make her the firſt Overture.

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:53606:165"/> he ſaid nothing at all to her. All that he could do for the King s ſatisfaction was to engage her to come to Court.

                  <p>Madam de <hi>Vernueil,</hi> knew ſo well how to make her beſt advantage of the King's Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy upon the ill ſucceſs of his other Amours, that ſhe triumph d over all her Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals: tho' the Counteſs of <hi>Moret,</hi> within a few dayes after, was brought to Bed of a Son, who was the ſame <hi>Antony</hi> of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> Count of <hi>Moret,</hi> who in the next Reign, was ſlain at the Battel of <hi>Caſtelnauari,</hi> fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> s Army. More then this, the Marchioneſs, thinking to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the King's Paſſion, by rowſing his jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie; ſpread abroad a Report, that the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> had a deſire to Marry her, and had caus'd the <hi>Banes</hi> to be publiſh'd unknown to that Prince who never thought of her, but addreſs'd all his Vows to Madam <hi>d' Entragues</hi> her Siſter.

                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:53606:165"/>
                  <p>1607. The King being inform'd that ſome body ſlipt in every Night into Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>d' Entragues</hi>'s Lodgings, thought it had been the Duke of Guiſe, and that he went to Viſit the Marchioneſs of <hi>Vernueil.</hi> Thereupon, he ſpoke to the Prince about it, who appear'd ſo aſtoniſhd, that the King perceiving his Innocence by the marks of Amazement which he diſcover'd in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and entruſted him to make the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery. Upon that, the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> ſet his Spies to work the ſame Night, who ſaw <hi>Baſſompierre</hi> make his Entrance, but could not tell who he was, becauſe he was wrapt up in his Cloak, upon which nevertheleſs they could diſcern the Order of the Holy Ghoſt upon it. That Cloak belong'd to <hi>Bellegard,</hi> only he had lent it to the Marquiſs, by reaſon of a ſhowre of Rain that fell juſt after they had ſup'd. The Spies therefore abus'd by that appearance, reported to the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> that they had ſeen a Young Chevalier whip in at the back Door, before which they watch'd.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> not being able togather any thing from this blind Relation, ſent two of his own Servants to the ſame place, to watch his happy Rival at his coming out. But <hi>Baſſompierre</hi> obſerving that he had Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels upon him, took the more care of himſelf; which was the Reaſon, that they could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Duke nothing but what confirm'd him in his miſtake; ſo that after he had made
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:53606:166"/> a thouſand Reflections upon this Adventure, he fix'd upon <hi>Bellegarde,</hi> who was the only Young Knight that could pretend to ſo much good Fortune. On the otherſide, <hi>Baſſompierre</hi> acquainted <hi>Mademoiſelle d' Entragues,</hi> as ſoon as ſhe was awake, of what had happen'd, to the end ſhe might be ready with her Anſwer to the Duke of <hi>Guiſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That Jealous Lover, eager after the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of this ſame hidden Secret, went the next Morning to give <hi>Bellegard</hi> a Viſit; but he could not be admitted. They told him the Marquiſs had been troubled all Night with the Toothach, and that he would not be ſeen till the Evening. Which confirm'd the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> in his Suſpitions; imagining that <hi>Bellegard</hi> lay a bed all day, to fetch up the Sleep he had loſt in the Night. From thence he went to <hi>Baſſompierre,</hi> and finding him abed, deſir'd him to riſe and put on his Night-Gown, that they might have a little Diſcourſe together. The Marquiſs believing he had been diſcover'd, roſe immediately to hear what his Rival had to ſay to him. But all his Alarums ceas'd as ſoon as he heard the Duke deliver himſelf in the following manner. What would you ſay Marquiſs, ſaid He, if the Grand Squire ſhould be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter belov d then you, or all the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, by Madam <hi>d' Entragues.</hi> I would ſay, reply'd <hi>Baſſompierre,</hi> very coldly, that cannot be, and that neither He nor She have any deſign one upon another. How eaſily are
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:53606:166"/> Lovers deceiv'd reply'd the Duke. I would have ſworn as well as you, that ſhe had been as chaſt as <hi>Diana;</hi> yet 'tis very true that the Grand Squire was with her all Night; and that he did not leave her till four a Clock in the morning. He was ſeen to go in, and my <hi>Valets de Chambre,</hi> ſaw him go along fo careleſly, and minding ſo little the Diſcovery of his happineſs, that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much as took care to hide the Star upon His Cloak.</p>
                  <p>During this Diſcourſe the Duke and the Marquiſs walk'd together very faſt; at what time the latter perceiv'd the Cloak, which the Duke had taken for <hi>Bellegardes,</hi> folded up in ſuch a manner that the Croſs appear'd outermoſt. Preſently he clap'd himſelf down upon it, for fear a Teſtimony ſo clear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all contradicton ſhould betray his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, nor would he be perſwaded to riſe, tho' the Duke Importunately preſs'd him to walk on, till one of his Valets, to whom he had made a ſign, had carry d it out of the Room, when his Rivals back was turn'd. In the mean time, he made a ſhew of being very much troubled, and ſtorm'd with a good Grace, againſt the inconſtancy of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demoiſelle d' Entragues,</hi> and when the Cloak was out of danger he roſe up and walk'd on with the Duke as long as he ſtay d.</p>
                  <p>So ſoon as the Duke was gone, <hi>Baſſompierre</hi> gave notice to Madam <hi>d' Entragues</hi> of the Dukes miſtake, and that ſame Young Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, the more to confirm him in it, treated

                     <hi>Bellegarde</hi> before his Face as if they had been the moſt Intimate Perſons in the World. The next Morning the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> wag d War with the Grand Squire, who unwilling to diſſabuſe him return'd him Ambiguous Anſwers. <hi>Bellegarde</hi> gave an account of all that Diſcourſe to Madam <hi>d' Entragues,</hi> who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd his Conduct, and deſir'd him to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue it; by which means all the Kings and the Dukes Suſpicious fell upon the Grand-Squire. Thereupon they inform'd Madam <hi>d' Entragues</hi> of her Daughter's Familiarity with him; which was the reaſon that ſhe watch d her more narrowly. One Morning, as ſhe drew the Curtain to Spit, ſhe obſerv d that <hi>Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle</hi>'s Bed, who lay in the Room, was thrown open, and that the Bird was Flown<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhe preſently ſuſpected the Truth, and riſing went ſoftly into the Wardrobe; where ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Door belonging to the Private Staires open, ſhe call'd out; at what time, her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hearing her Voice roſe with all ſpeed from <hi>Baſſompierre,</hi> and went to her. Madam <hi>d' En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tragues,</hi> after ſhe had given her Daughter two or three Wherets o'th' Ear in the Tranſports of her Paſſion, caus'd the Door of the Privy Staires to be broke open, becauſe <hi>Baſſompierre</hi> had bolted it within ſide, that he might have leiſure to dreſs himſelf. When 'twas open, up ſhe ran in great haſt three Stories high; but ſhe was ſtrangely ſurpriz d to find no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy there; but much more to ſee the Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devouze-Chamber furniſh'd with <hi>Zamet</hi>'s beſt Furniture, and trick'd up with Silver
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:53606:167"/> Sconces and Candleſticks. Thus ended this Intercourſe: But Love which is Ingenious, provided other ways for thoſe two Lovers to meet one another at <hi>Mademoiſelle Dazi</hi>'s, whom they made their Confident. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs this hurly-burly totally extidguiſh'd all the King s Suſpitions of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi>'s having an Intreague with the Marchioneſs of <hi>Vernueil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There was ſome Diſcourſe of Marrying <hi>Mademoiſelle d' Entragues</hi> to the Count <hi>d' Achè</hi> in <hi>Anvergne.</hi> But that Match was broken off upon examination of the Articles: after which the Marchioneſs of <hi>Vernueil,</hi> and her Siſter went to paſs away the fair Seaſon at the Marchioneſs of <hi>Conflans</hi>'s near <hi>Charenton,</hi> about whoſe Houſe the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> and <hi>Baſſompierre</hi> walk'd their Rounds every Night. But at laſt <hi>Baſſompierre</hi> broke off altogether with <hi>Mademoiſelle d' Entragues,</hi> aſpiring to a more Advantageous Alliance; and beg'd leave of the King to marry <hi>Mademoiſelle de Montmorency,</hi> and to treat with the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> for his Employment of firſt Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of his Chamber. Nor did the King believe it only enough to grant him what he ask'd, but conſented alſo in favour of the Match, that the Conſtable, who was out of Favour, ſhould return to Court. The next morning, at the King's riſing, he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to kiſs his Hands, had a Gracious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, and in the afternoon the King went to viſit the Dutcheſs of <hi>Angoleſme,</hi> where
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:53606:168"/> 
                     <hi>Mademoiſelle de Montmorancy</hi> Lodg'd, and where he ſaw Madam <hi>d' Eſſars,</hi> with whom he preſently embarqu'd, and had two Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters by her, who betook themſelves to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious lives, the Eldeſt being made Abbeſs of <hi>Fonteleraut:</hi> But after the death of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, ſhe privately marri'd <hi>Lewis</hi> Cardinal of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> the Brother of <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Guiſe.</hi> The Cardinal had obtain'd a diſpenſation from the Pope for holding two Benefices, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his marriage; but after his death, the Duke ſeiz'd upon the Contract and the Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, which was the reaſon that <hi>Mademoiſelle de Eſſars</hi> was never accounted any other then his Concubine. However ſhe had three Children by that Conjunction, the Eldeſt, who dy'd Biſhop of <hi>Condom,</hi> the Marquiſs of <hi>Romorantin,</hi> and a Daughter marri'd to the Marquiſs of <hi>Rhodes.</hi> But notwithſtanding the affronts that were put upon her, under the next Raign ſhe marri'd the Marquiſs <hi>du Hallier,</hi> afterwards Marſhal <hi>de l' Hopital.</hi> Her Marriage with the Cardinal <hi>de Guiſe,</hi> and the Diſpenſation, after they had happen'd into the cuſtody of ſeveral, at length fell into the Hands of <hi>Mademoiſelle de Guiſe,</hi> who dyd in 1608. The Marchioneſs of <hi>Romorantin,</hi> underſtanding that ſhe was draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing toward her end, caus'd her Confeſſor to lay it home to her Conſcience, and make her ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that it would be a piece of injuſtice to detain thoſe Writings that might be ſervicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to reeſtabliſh the low Eſtate of her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and preſerve their claim of Succeſſion
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:53606:168"/> to the Houſe of <hi>Guiſe.</hi> Upon which the dying Princeſs was over-rul'd, and ſent the reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted Papers in a Box by an unknown hand to Madam <hi>de Romorantin.</hi> Who immediately went to Court, and throwing herſelf at the King's Feet, beſought his Protection. To whom that Great Prince, whoſe profound wiſdom appear d in his meaneſt Actions, made anſwer, that ſhe muſt addreſs her ſelf to his Parliament, whoſe buſineſs it was to take Cognizance of thoſe Differences. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to Madam <hi>de Montmorancy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> who was Brother-in-Law to the Conſtable, took it ill, that a Match ſhould be treated of and he not be acquainted with it; and therefore he reſolv'd to croſs it. One day, that the King had been viſiting Madam <hi>de Montmorancy</hi> at the Queens lodgings, and was very paſſionately crying up her Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the Duke drew him aſide, and told him that he wonder'd he had given his conſent to the marriage of that Lady with <hi>Baſſompierre,</hi> ſince there were no other matches that were fit for his Nephew the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> but either ſhe or the Dutcheſs of <hi>Main,</hi> and ſeeing Policy would not admit him to ſuffer the Head of the League, too powerfull already to advance his Credit by an Alliance, he was oblig'd to give Madam <hi>de Montmorency</hi> to the Prince. The King heard his advice without making any anſwer, but the next day going to ſee the Practice of a Ball, that was to be danc'd at the <hi>Louvre, Bellegard</hi> cry'd up the Charmes
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:53606:169"/> of that Lady, to ſuch a degree, that the King reſolv'd to undertake the Conqueſt of her himſelf. And in regard that for the better bringing about his Deſign, 'twas convenient ſhe ſhould marry a Man for whom ſhe had no kindneſs, he was deſirous of being ſatisfi'd what opinion ſhe had of <hi>Baſſompierre.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this purpoſe an Opportunity offer'd it ſelf within a few days: for being conſtrain'd by a fit of the Gout to keep his Bed, he was Viſited by Madam <hi>d' Angouleme</hi> and her Niece; and while the Count of <hi>Grammont</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd the Dutcheſs, the King entertain'd <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demoiſelle de Montmorency,</hi> and told her, that he would love her as his own Daughter, and Lodge her in the <hi>Louvre,</hi> during <hi>Baſſompierres</hi> year of waiting, and deſir'd her to tell him ingenuouſly, whither ſhe were pleas'd with her Match or no; for that otherwiſe he would break it off, and marry her to his Nephew the Prince of <hi>Conde. Mad. de Montmorancy,</hi> who did not penetrate the King's deſign, freely anſwer'd him, that ſince it was her Fathers will, ſhe ſhould think her ſelf very happy with the Marquiſs. <hi>Henry</hi> IV. faign'd to be extremely glad of it; but reſolv'd within himſelf to find her out ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Husband.</p>
                  <p>The next morning betimes he ſent for <hi>Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſompierre,</hi> and after he had careſs'd him after an extraordinary manner, told him, that he had a full intention to marry him. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis, ignorant of what he aim'd at, made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that had it not been for the Conſtables
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:53606:169"/> Gout, his Nuptials had been already conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated. That's not my meaning, reply'd the King, my deſign is to marry ye with <hi>Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle de Aumale,</hi> and in conſideration of that marriage, to revive the Dutchy of <hi>Aumale</hi> in her Perſon. <hi>Baſſompierre</hi> interrupting him, ask'd his Majeſty, whether 'twas his pleaſure that he ſhould have two Wives? 'Tis requiſite, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd the King, that I ſhould ſpeak to thee as a friend: I am in Love my ſelf, with <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demoiſelle de Montmorancy:</hi> If thou marrieſt her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſhe love thee, I ſhall hate thee; and if ſhe have an affection for me, then wilt thou be my Enemy: 'Tis better to avoid an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that may break our friendſhip: I have a kindneſs for thee, and I ſhould feel a terrible combat within my ſelf, ſhould I be conſtrain'd to remove my favour from thee. I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to marry that Lady to my Nephew the Prince of <hi>Conde.</hi> She will be the Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my old Age, and I will give my Nephew who is young, and loves hunting better then Ladies, a hunder'd thouſand <hi>Franks</hi> a year for his paſtime, without deſiring any thing more from her that I deſign for his Wife but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent affection. <hi>Baſſompierre,</hi> who ſaw well that he ſhould but augment the King's Paſſion by reluctancy, reſolv'd to yeild him up chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully a Bleſſing which he could not preſerve to himſelf, whither he would or no. 'Tis a long time Sir, ſaid he, that I have wiſht for an op<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>portunity to let your Majeſty ſee my entire devotion to your Majeſties Service; and now
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:53606:170"/> I have met with one, that anſwers my deſires; ſince the ſacrifice which I offer to your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, is the greateſt that Man can be capable of receiving. I renounce at the ſame time for the love I bear your Majeſty a ſplendid Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; and a Lady altogether lovely, for whom I have an affection, the fervency and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence of which I am not able to expreſs. Yet I offer up all theſe advantages, without any trouble to my ſelf, or any repining in the leaſt: and I wiſh that this intreague may bring as much joy to your Majeſty, as the loſs of my hopes affliction to my ſelf, ſhould I ſurrender 'em to any other then my Maſter: a Maſter whoſe Vertues I no leſs admire then I reverence his high Extraction. Theſe words ſo mollifi'd the King, that he melted into tears, embrac'd <hi>Baſſompierre,</hi> and promis'd him to take care of his Fortune: he alſo talk d to him of marrying <hi>Mademoiſelle de Aumale;</hi> but <hi>Baſſompierre</hi> beſought him to be contented with taking from him the perſon that he lov'd, without impoſing upon him a perſon that he could not affect.</p>
                  <p>In the Afternoon the King ſitting up in his bed to play at Hazard with <hi>Baſſompierre,</hi> and ſome other Courtiers, and Madam <hi>d'Angouleme,</hi> together with her Neice, coming to give him a viſit, he caus d the Dutcheſs to come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Wall and the Bedſide, where he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd her for ſome time in private. All that while, Madam <hi>de Montmorency,</hi> who knew nothing of the alteration of the King's mind,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:53606:170"/> talk'd to the Marquiſs, till the King beckning her to come to him, inform'd her of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, and then went on with his diſcourſe to the Dutcheſs; while her Neice retiring, ſhrugg'd up her ſhoulders, to let <hi>Baſſompierre</hi> underſtand the aſtoniſhment ſhe was in.</p>
                  <p>But tho that Action of Madam <hi>de Montmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency</hi> diſcover'd nothing to <hi>Baſſompierre</hi> but what he underſtood before, he could not avoid the aſſaults of an inward anguiſh, receiving that confirmation of his misfortune. He gave over play, and went out of the King's Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, feigning that his Noſe bled. His Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants brought him his Hat and his Cloak to the Stairs, and <hi>Betinghen</hi> put up his Money which he had left at random upon the Table. As for the diſpairing Lover, he put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the Duke of <hi>Epernons</hi> Coach which he found next at hand, not being able to get to his own, and caus'd the Coachman to drive him home, where be continu'd lockt up up for two or three days together, without ſuffering any Strangers to come at him. When he return'd to Court, the Prince of <hi>Condè,</hi> who had made a formal demand of Madam <hi>de Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morency,</hi> deſir'd his company in the firſt viſit that he pay'd his Miſtreſs. But tho the Marquiſs were ſomewhat recover'd from his affliction, and to find ſome paſtime for his love, had renew'd his intreague with Madam <hi>d' Entragues,</hi> whom he had met at Madam <hi>de Senteny</hi>'s, yet could he not reſolve, unleſs by the King's expreſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, to ſubmit to a compliance that would
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:53606:171"/> aſſur'dly put his heart upon the moſt ſevere Tryal, that ever a Lover was expos d to. The Cermonies of Affiiancing were perform d in the Gallery of the <hi>Louvre,</hi> where the King was pleas'd out of an unlucky wantonneſs to lean upon <hi>Baſſompierre</hi>'s Shouldiers, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to make him ſtay with the affianc'd couple ſo long as the Ceremony laſted. But the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Lover could notwithſtand ſo many aſſaults. His diſpair upon the ſight of that fatal Ceremony threw him into a Fever, which had like to have coſt him his life.</p>
                  <p>When he was recover'd, Fortune, that took delight in perſecuting him, rais d him a new Adventure, which tho of leſs conſequence, yet put him to a great deal of trouble. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millo Simoni,</hi> Eſquire to the Queen lodg'd in a little Street, right againſt the Door of the Mint, and next door to Madam <hi>d'Entra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues</hi> Houſe, and coming home one Evening, he found a young man a bed with his Landlady, for whom he had a kindneſs. Preſently he call'd up the people of the Houſe, who gave his Rival ſeveral cuts with their Swords, and thruſt him out of d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ors in his Shirt. He was ſo dangerouſly wounded that after he had gone about fifty Paces, he ſunk down under Madam <hi>d' Entragues</hi> windows, expecting eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moment to breath his laſt. At the ſame time a Gentleman, who had ſome knowledge of <hi>Baſſompierre</hi> s affairs; happen'd to paſs by, and taking the dying perſon for the Varquiſs, knockt at his door, call'd out his Servants,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:53606:171"/> and bid 'em go and help their Maſter if he were capable of relief, or remove him if he were dead.</p>
                  <p>The Marquiſſes Servants were eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to believe the ſtory which the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman told 'em, becauſe their Maſter went out that Evening in diſguiſe, in proſecution of ſome happy adventure, as he was often wont to do. They ran without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration to the place, where the body by this time, almoſt breathleſs, lay, and alltoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther carri d it into their Maſters Houſe; tho when the Candles came, and that they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd their error, they carry'd it away to a Surgeon. Neverthleſs, the noiſe of this acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent being ſpread about all over the City, gave an occaſion to ſeveral Joakes and Jeaſtſ which reflected all upon <hi>Mademoiſelles</hi> Honour.</p>
                  <p>This new vexation hinder'd the Marquiſs from being fully ſenſible of that Affliction in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which the Nuptials of the Prince of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,</hi> ſolemniz'd at <hi>Chantilli,</hi> would otherwiſe have plung'd him. The King would fain have marri d him to <hi>Mademoiſelle de Chantilli,</hi> and to that purpoſe would have erected the Lorſhip of <hi>Beauprez</hi> into a Dukedom and Peerage for his ſake. But the Marquiſs's heart was not at liberty to think of new engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>1670. The King by Marrying Madam de <hi>Montmorency</hi> with the Prince for whom ſhe had no Conjugal affection, verily thought to
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:53606:172"/> find leſs difficulty in the proſecuting of his Amours; but they had made ſuch a noiſe, that the Young Prince did not think it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hov'd him to brook the continuance of the Kings Courtſhip, without making himſelf the Table talk of the whole Court. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reſolv'd to break off that Intercourſe by retiring privately from <hi>Fontain Bleau</hi> where the Court then lay, and withdrawing into the Low Country's. And preparing all things in a readineſs for his retreate, He took Horſe one morning with <hi>Rochefort, Touray,</hi> an Eſquire, who took up Madam the Princeſs behind him, <hi>Mademoiſelle de Certeaux,</hi> and a waiting Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, call'd <hi>Phil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>pette.</hi> He lay at <hi>Muret,</hi> and thence continu'd his Journy to <hi>Landrecy.</hi> As for the King, he was then playing in his lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Cabinet, where <hi>d' Elboeuf</hi> brought him the Tidings which were confirm'd immediately after by the Captain of the Watch. Upon which the King cry'd out to <hi>Baſſompierre</hi> that ſtood neareſt to him, with a tranſport not eaſie to be expreſt, My dear Friend I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, This Man is carrying away his Wife into a Wood; I know not whether it be to kill her, or to hurry her out of <hi>France;</hi> have a care of my money, and play on the Game, while I go and examin the particulars of this Eſcape. And ſo ſaying he went up into another Chamber, beckning to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſs of <hi>Coeuvres,</hi> the Count of <hi>Cramail, d' El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boeuf</hi> and <hi>Lomenie</hi> to follow him, and asking their advice in a ſtrange Confuſion and Hurry,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:53606:172"/> furiouſly graſp'd at the firſt propoſal, and commanded <hi>de Lomenie</hi> to make diſpatches for the proſecution of it: but the next mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, conſidering the impoſſibility of it, he alter d his Opinion. One advis'd him to ſend the Captain of the Watch with his Archers alter the Prince with orders to ſtop him: another to give the ſame Commiſſion to <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagny,</hi> and <hi>Bouvin,</hi> and a third to poſt away <hi>Vaubecourt,</hi> then at Court, to the Frontiers of <hi>Lorrain</hi> to hinder his Paſſage.</p>
                  <p>But the King well underſtanding how little ſolidity there was in any of thoſe Projects, ſent for his principal Miniſters to underſtand their Opinions upon a matter, wherein his heart was ſo deeply concern'd. The Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor arriv'd firſt of all, who after the King had ſet forth the matter of Fact, made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer with a Gravity becoming his Dignity, that the Prince of <hi>Condè</hi> had not taken the Right Courſe; that it was to be wiſh'd, he had been better advis'd; that he ought to have mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated his Heart. The King impatient of this Diſcourſe, and interrupting him in a great Paſſion, this is not the buſineſs ſaid he, that I ask yee,'tis your Advice, Monſieur Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor that I require. Then the ſame Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter reſuming his Oration, Be it ſo added He; then I think the beſt way is to iſſue forth effectual and ſtrong Declarations againſt him, and all that ſhall follow him, or lend him any Aſſiſtance. While the Chancellor was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering his formal hum drum, <hi>Villeroy</hi> enter'd
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:53606:173"/> the Room, to whom the King, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be tyr'd with the Chancellors flegme, addreſs'd himſelf, and after he had in few words declar'd the buſineſs in hand, demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his opinion. <hi>Villeroy,</hi> after he had twice ſhrug'd up his Shoulders to ſignifie his aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, made anſwer, that it behov'd His Majeſty to ſend his Curriers to all his Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors at the Courts of Foreign Princes, to give 'em notice of the Princes departure without his leave, nay and againſt his prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, to the end they might take all ſuch courſes as were requiſite in the Courts where they reſided, and repreſent to the Soveraigns to whom they were ſent, that they ought not admit the Prince into their Territory's, but rather ſend him back to his Majeſty. After <hi>Villeroy</hi> had done ſpeaking, the King turn d toward the Preſident <hi>Jean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nin</hi> and bid him give his Advice; which he did without any Heſitation. Sir, ſaid He, I think you cannot do better then to ſend after him one of the Captains of your Guards, to try whether they can bring him back by force, with orders in caſe his endeaveurs prove un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuccesful, to go to the Prince in whoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions he ſhelters himſelf, and threaten him with a War, if he refuſes to deliver him. In my opinion his departure was not premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, nor has lie done any preceding Act that may deſerve Reception or Protection. Without queſtion he has betaken himſelf into the Low Countries, and the Archduke who
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:53606:173"/> neither knows him, nor has receiv'd any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Order from <hi>Spain</hi> to ſupport him, and who dreads your Majeſty as much as he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours your Perſon, will never for his ſake incur the anger of the greateſt Monarch in <hi>Europe,</hi> and abide the effects of it, but either oblige the Prince to depart his Dominions, or deliver him up into your Majeſties Hands.</p>
                  <p>The King reliſh'd this expedient, but he would not poſitively determin upon any thing, till he had taken the advice of the Duke of <hi>Sully,</hi> who came not in till a long time after the reſt with a moroſe Air, and a frowning Countenance. To whom the King, advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing toward him, Sir, ſaid he, my Nephew is gone and has carry'd away his Wife along with him. Sir, reply'd the Duke, I do not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at it at all: 'tis no more then what I fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw: and I told you ſome while ſince, that he would commit this piece of Folly. Had you follow'd the counſel I gave you when he went to <hi>Muret,</hi> you would have put him in the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> and you would have found him now, where I would have been ſure to have kept him ſafe. What is done can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be undone, but give me your advice what courſe I ſhall now take by way of redreſs. By my Troth, Sir, I cannot tell, reply'd the Duke; but let me return to the <hi>Arſenal,</hi> where I will Sup and go to Bed, and then as I lye muſing in the night, I ſhall think upon ſome expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, which I will communicate to your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty to morrow morning. No, purſu'd the King,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:53606:174"/> I will have you tell me your thoughts preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. I muſt then conſider a little, reply'd <hi>Sully,</hi> and at the ſame time turning himſelf to the Window that lookt into the Court, after he had ſtood drumming a while with his Fingers upon the Board, he return'd to the King, who ask'd him whither he had thought upon the buſineſs and what he ought to do? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, reply'd the Duke. How! nothing? reply'd the King, very much ſurpriz'd. I ſay, nothing at all, added <hi>Sully.</hi> If you do nothing at all, and thereby ſhew that you do not va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue the Prince, but rather contemn him, no body will aſſiſt him; no, not his deareſt friends, nor the moſt zealous of the Officers he has left here, and within three months pinch d by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and tyr'd with the flouts and ſcoffs that will be put upon him, he will return and implore your Clemency. On the other ſide, if you are eager to recall him, you will put a value upon him: he will be with Money aſſiſted by ſeveral perſons of your Court, and he will find thoſe that will protect him, on purpoſe to create you trouble, who would have aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd him had they been convinc'd how little you minded his abſence. But the King, whoſe thoughts were in too great a ferment to reliſh ſuch judicious advice, reſolv'd upon what the Preſident <hi>Jeannin</hi> had given him, which as it was more blunt and harſh, ſo it flatter'd his Paſſion the more, and the next morning diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd away the Marquiſs of <hi>Pralin</hi> as well to the Prince, as to the Archduke.</p>

                  <p>The Marquiſs could not overtake the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and therefore repair'd to <hi>Marimont</hi> to the Archduke, of whom he immediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Audience, and went with the Ordinary Embaſſador. He lay'd before the Archduke that <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Bourbon</hi> Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Wife the occaſion of his Pretence, to cover his deſign of raiſing troubles in <hi>France,</hi> had withdrawn himſelf into the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories under his Government, and therefore he deſir'd him in his Maſters name to cauſe him to be apprehended. To which the Archduke reply'd that he thought he had done enough in not receiving the Prince, but that he could not refuſe him free paſſage, and that it ſhould not be long of him, that he did not return into <hi>France,</hi> as one that zealouſly wiſh'd the King's particular ſatisfaction, and the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility of the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, that the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> did not ſtay in the <hi>Low Countries;</hi> for he paſs'd for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to <hi>Cologne,</hi> and had left the Princeſs his Wife at <hi>Breda</hi> with the Princeſs of <hi>Orange,</hi> his Siſter, who carry'd her afterwards to <hi>Bruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,</hi> whether the Prince her Husband came in a ſhort time after.

But ſoon after he was no longer Maſter of the differences: for the Catholick King ſent his orders wherein he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd that 'twas his Pleaſure to grant his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection to the Prince of <hi>Conde.</hi> This Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ſo enflam'd his Courage, that he made it his buſineſs to juſtifie his departure out of the Kingdom, and publiſh'd ſome matters of Fact, of which the greateſt part were ſuppos d. To the ſame purpoſe alſo he wrote to Pope <hi>Clement</hi> VII. and Cardinal <hi>Borgheſe,</hi> his Nephew, in terms that might make his Letters paſs for ſo many Manifeſtos.</p>
                  <p>Now in regard the King had given no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to <hi>Pralin</hi> to enter into any Negotiation with his Nephew, ſo ſoon as he heard that he was return'd to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> he ſent the Marquiſs of <hi>Couvres,</hi> with the Character of his Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Ambaſſador; who as ſoon as he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd preſs'd the Archduke to deliver the Princeſs of <hi>Conde</hi> either into the Hands of the Conſtable her Father, or of the Dutcheſs of <hi>Angouleme</hi> her Aunt. But the Archduke declar d that he would never diſpoſe of her Perſon, but with the conſent of her Husband.
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:53606:175"/> So that <hi>Couvrs</hi> finding his Negtiation did not take effect, bethought himſelf of carrying away the Princeſs by force.</p>
                  <p>There was ſome ſort of coldneſs in Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between her and the Prince; whither it were out of a Natural Antipathy, or out of vexation to ſee her ſelf ſo far<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> remote from the Court of <hi>France:</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> had taken care to cheriſh this embitterment, to bring about the King's deſignes. The Marquiſs of <hi>Coeuvres</hi> being inform'd of her Inclinations. endeavour'd to perſwade her to ſuffer her ſelf to be taken forcibly away; to which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal ſhe could not a long time tell what an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſhe ſhould give. On the other ſide, ſhe was not ſatisfi'd with the Prince her Husband; ſhe ſaw herſelf, to her great grief, under the Tyranny of the <hi>Spaniards:</hi> The Archdukes Court by no means pleas'd her; ſeeing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing there that came near the Magificence of that of <hi>France;</hi> and beſides, ſhe moſt paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately deſir d to be with her Father and her Aunt, who by their Letters ſignifi d the ſame earneſtneſs on their part. But on the other ſide, ſhe durſt not forſake her Husband, to put her ſelf into the hands of a Perſon who was bound by no tye to her intereſt; and ſhe was equally afraid of falling into the hands of a Incens'd Husband, and of giving Obloquy an occaſion to blame her Conduct. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, after ſhe had a long time revolv'd theſe different reflections in her mind, the deſire of ſeeing her Family once again, and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:53606:176"/> of returning into <hi>France</hi> prevail'd above all other conſiderations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Coeuvres</hi>'s deſign was to carry her away from <hi>Bruſſels</hi> in the Night, and to get ſo far upon the Roade while it continu d dark, that when her flight was diſcover'd, it ſhould be impoſſible to overtake 'em.

                  <p>Now in regard there was a neceſſity of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying ſeveral perſons in the execution of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t that the perſons concern'd had an inkling of it. The firſt perſon who had notice of it was the Count of <hi>Buquoy,</hi> Grand Maſter of the Ordinace in <hi>Flanders,</hi> who carri'd the news to the Archduke and <hi>Spinola.</hi> Immediately a Council was held, wherein it was reſolv'd, that under ſome fair pretence, the Princeſs ſhould be invited to lodge in the Palace with the Archduke and the Infanta. This was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to the Prince of <hi>Conde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the miſtery to him; withall they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuated into him, that in regard there was ſome unkindneſs between him and his Wife, 'twould be the beſt way to ſeparate a while, that he might have time to recover himſelf from his diſguſt. To which the Prince conſented with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſcruple; upon thoſe aſſurances that
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:53606:176"/> the Archduke and the Infanta gave him; not to part with her out of their Cuſtody with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Conſent. Nor durſt the Princeſs, nor <hi>Coeuvres</hi> oppoſe it, not having any manifeſt pretence to excuſe themſelves, beſides that hey were in hopes of executing their deſigns before the change of her lodging. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, becauſe they could not adjuſt all their Meaſures during the time that the Princeſs was to ſtay in the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Palace, therefore 'twas thought convenient, for the gaining of three or four days more, that the Princeſs her ſelf, with whom he faign'd to be in Love, ſhould entreat <hi>Spinola</hi> to give her a Ball at his Houſe: the but crafty <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> who ſmelt the deſign, excus'd himſelf neatly. However <hi>Coeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vres,</hi> no ways diſcourag'd by this unlucky ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, reſolv'd to carry away the Princeſs upon <hi>Saturday</hi> night, being the 13th of <hi>Feb.</hi> 1610. becauſe ſhe was to remove into the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace the next day, being <hi>Sunday.</hi> She pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſhe was ill, for fear her Husband ſhould lye with her, which was a thing that very rarely happen'd, and hinder from mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Eſcape.</p>
                  <p>The Archduke who was inform'd of every thing by <hi>Buquoy,</hi> gave notice of it, by <hi>Spinola,</hi> to the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> to whom they had never made any diſcovery till then, for fear he ſhould make a noiſe to no purpoſe, and it was reſolv'd that the Archduke ſhould be requeſted to order the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Houſe to be guarded all the Night. <hi>Conde</hi> was ſo alarum d
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:53606:177"/> at what <hi>Spinola</hi> had told him, that not being able to keep the ſecret, after he had taken ſufficient care to diſappoint the enterprize, he brake out into frivolous complaints. As for <hi>Coeuvres</hi> he deny'd every thing, becauſe he had as yet done nothing to convict him; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was nothing more to be done, he diſpatch'd away a Courrier to the King for new Orders upon this unexpected Change.</p>
                  <p>The King perceiving that Artifice had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing avail'd him, reſolv'd to make uſe of Force to get the Princeſs of <hi>Conde</hi> out of the hands of the Archduke, and to declare War againſt the moſt Catholick King. To which purpoſe he ſounded <hi>James</hi> VI. who after the Death of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> ſucceeded to the Crowns of <hi>England, Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> and endeavour'd to oblige him to break with the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> But he being already grown in years, was unwilling to engage in a War of that conſequence.</p>
                  <p>Upon which, <hi>Hen.</hi> IV. made a League with the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and the States of the United Provinces who were moſt concern'd to humble the Pride of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> The Death of the Duke, of <hi>Cleves</hi> upon which a difference aroſe between the Elector of <hi>Brandenbourgh</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Newburgh</hi> about the Succeſſion, furniſh'd the Moſt Chriſtian King with a ſpecious pretence to take Armes, and he began to ſend his Forces toward the <hi>Low Countries;</hi> but the tragical end of that Prince diſappointed all his vaſt deſigns.

                  <p>THE Amours of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. afford but little matter, becauſe that if he caſt a particular eye upon any Lady of the Court, 'twas rather a Paſtime then any real Paſſion. Nevertheleſs, there were Intreagues wherein the Ladies bore a part, which I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to relate with as much conciſeneſs and clearneſs as the Thing will give me leave. The Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> a Favorite of <hi>Charles</hi> I. King of Great <hi>Britain</hi> was come to <hi>Paris,</hi> to conduct Madam <hi>Henrietta</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> whom his Maſter had marri'd into <hi>England,</hi> but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth, to ſet up a Faction in the Kingdom, which might prevent the King from putting his deſign againſt the Hereticks in execution. To which purpoſe he thought it neceſſary to acquire ſome familiarity among the Lady's who had moſt Credit at Court; as being perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that 'twas a difficult thing for perſons of their Sex, to conceal the greateſt ſecrecies from thoſe who are once ſo happy as to have touch'd their Hearts. The Daughter of the Duke of <hi>Montbaſon,</hi> who after the death of the Conſtable <hi>de Luynes,</hi> marry'd in ſecond Wedlock to the Prince of <hi>Joyinville,</hi> and who was
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:53606:178"/> then call'd the Duke of <hi>Chevreuſe,</hi> was ſhe whom <hi>Buckingham</hi> deem'd the moſt proper to ſecond his deſigns. Her Beauty had purchas'd her an abſolute power over all the great Lords of the Kingdom. She had a moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſive Eloquence, a boundleſs Ambition, and a wanton Humour, which made her co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet the Conqueſt of all thoſe whom ſhe thought worthy of particular diſtinction. <hi>Buckingham,</hi> who had a penetrating judgment, quickly underſtood her Character, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd that the Grand Prior, natural Son to <hi>Henry</hi> IV. and the Count of <hi>Chalais</hi> were the moſt aſſiduous to pay her homage, and the two perſons likewiſe for whom ſhe had the greateſt value, but that ſhe treated 'em with ſo much equality, that they could not diſcover which way her heart moſt enclin'd. <hi>Buckingham</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving inſinuated himſelf into their confidence, offer d 'em to make the Dutcheſs explain her ſelf: and tho a man would have thought a Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſo lovely as the Duke, a very improper perſon to fulfill the Truſt which they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd in him, yet they never ſuſpected any thing; becauſe that being a Stranger, and one that was but to make a ſhort ſtay in <hi>France,</hi> they did not believe he would engage in an Intreague with Madam <hi>de Chevreuſe.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> the King's Brother, was then at <hi>Limours,</hi> and the Dutcheſs at <hi>Dampierre,</hi> that lye not above ten Leagues a ſunder. The Grand Prior and <hi>Chalais,</hi> who were the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi>'s principal Favorites carry'd <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi>
                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:53606:179"/> to <hi>Limours,</hi> from whence they went every Afternoon to <hi>Diampierre.</hi> During <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi>'s ſtay there, he invented every day ſome new Courtly feaſt to divertiſe the Dutcheſs, to which he always invited the two Lovers for fear they ſhould grow jealouſs. In the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he had the honour to converſe in private with the Dutcheſs, by the means of Madam <hi>de Vernet,</hi> her good friend, whom he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd in his Intereſts by his liberality. Now when he had receiv'd ſuch ſufficient proofs of the Dutcheſs of <hi>Chevreuſes</hi> Compliance, that he could no longer doubt but that ſhe lov d him in good earneſt, he told her that to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal their correſpondece from his Rivals, there was a neceſſity of engaging em in a Conſpiracy againſt Cardinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> who was at that time Chief Miniſter, and perſwade 'em, that tho they were alone together, yet they never ſpoke of any thing but of State Affairs. The Grand Prior, and <hi>Chalais</hi> eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fell into this Snare; and whereas they ſaw, to their great vexation that the Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans,</hi> their Maſter, had no ſhare in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, they immediately rellſh'd the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal which was made 'em, to perſwade the Prince to declare himſelf Head of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that they would ſet up, upon the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance which <hi>Buckingham</hi> gave em of the King of Great <hi>Britain</hi>'s Protection.</p>
                  <p>This Intreague could not be carri'd ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly, but that Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> had notice of it. However he would not preſently fly out

Therefore the principal aim of the Malecontents was to break off this Match and perſwade the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> to marry <hi>Mademoiſelle de Bourbon,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> s Siſter, and by that match to unite thoſe two Houſes in a ſtrict Alliance, or to put him upon looking out for ſome forraign Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, from whom he might have great Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and a Powerful Protection.

Madam <hi>de Chevre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe</hi> lai'd all her Snares to entrap Archduke <hi>Leopold</hi> the Emperors Brother, to whom the Catholick King had given the Government of the <hi>Low Countries;</hi> and the Duke <hi>d' Elboeuf</hi> made addreſſes to Madam <hi>de Grincalberque;</hi> but all theſe Amours were only tranſitory Gallantries: there was no body but the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> that embark'd himſelf in Intreagues of any long continuance, and ſuch indeed as prov d in good part the occaſion of moſt of the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of his Life.</p>
                  <p>This Prince, being the youngeſt Brother of his Family was deſign'd for the Church, and was promoted to the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>Rheims:</hi> but after his Brothers death, he quitted his Benefices; and courted <hi>Anna de Gonzaga,</hi> Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to the Princeſs <hi>Marie,</hi> of whom we have already made mention Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Alliance to be contrary to the good of the State, made uſe of the King's authority to prevent it, and order'd the Princeſs to be ſhut up in a Convent. The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi>
                     <pb n="129" facs="tcp:53606:181"/> enrag d to ſee his Paſſion croſs'd departed the Kingdom, and withdrew to <hi>Cologne,</hi> whither his Miſtreſs having made her eſcape, follow'd him in Mans Apparel; but he oblig'd her to return, and went to <hi>Bruſſells,</hi> where he met with the reſt of the Exiles. Now in regard there was no good Company there to his mind, he ſpent the greateſt part of the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noons with the Dutcheſs of <hi>Chevreuſe,</hi> his Kinſwoman, who fearing leaſt his aſſiduities ſhould create a jealouſie in the Archduke, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour d to engage him other where, and brought him acquainted with the Counteſs of <hi>Boſſu.</hi> She was a young Widow of a ſweet and blithe humour, and the Dutcheſs's great friend. It was ſo order'd that ſhe ſhould be of the Dukes ſide in a match at Cards, and ſhe put her ſelf to forward, that he coulde not chooſe but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn her an anſwer. 'Tis true, that for fear ſhe ſhould make a wrong judgment of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, ſhe preſently ſpoke to him about mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and the Duke declar'd to her that he deſir'd nothing ſo much, as to ſhare deſtinies with her, but in ſuch terms as ſufficiently ſhew'd, that he only ſought to divertiſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf during his Exile. But tho the Counteſs had ſounded his drift, yet ſhe made as if ſhe hade never perceiv'd it, hoping the more eaſily to engage him by her faigned Ingenuity.</p>
                  <p>One day ſhe carry'd him to a very ſtately Houſe of her's about a League from <hi>Bruſſells,</hi> and treated him with all the divertiſements that were proper for the Seaſon, which was
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:53606:182"/> the moſt pleaſant in all the whole year; for which the Duke could not chooſe but teſtifie his acknowledgment to her, and talk to her of love as he was us d to do. The Counteſs told him, that if he were ſo amorous as he would ſeem to make her believe, he ſhould ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf more eaneſtly deſirous of their Marriage The Duke ſwore to her that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that he more Paſſinonately wiſh'd for, then to ſpend the reſt of his life with ſo amaible a perſon as ſhe was, and that it was her fault if ſhe did not put it to the Tryal. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs taking him at his word, reply'd, that ſhe ſhould ſoon ſee whither his Proteſtations were ſincere, ſince ſhe had both a Notary and a Prieſt in the Houſe to marry 'em. The Duke was ſurpriz'd at this diſcourſe, but made as if he had not been ſo, and thought he might take his liberty without running any hazard, while he made the Dutcheſs the Cully of her own cunning; ſeeing that a Marriage of that nature wanting the formalities preſcrib'd by the Canon, and without the Kings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, was voyd in Law. The Dutcheſs therefore ſeeing the Duke ready to do what ſhe deſir'd, ſent for <hi>Manfele</hi> Almoner to the Army, who gave 'em the Nuptial Benediction, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens'd with asking the Baines, as if he had the ſame authority with the Biſhop of <hi>Mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</hi> Thus the Duke ſtay'd all that night with his new Spouſe, to whom he ſhew'd ſo much kindneſs and affection, that ſhe was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly ſatisfi'd with the happy ſucceſs of her
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:53606:182"/> deſigns. The next day he return'd back, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had deſir'd the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But notwithſtanding all the care they took to conceal this Adventure from publick knowledge, it reach'd the Ears of the Duke <hi>d' Elboeuf</hi> and the Dutcheſs of <hi>Chevreuſe</hi> who both upbraided him with it, as a piece of the fouleſt Treachery imaginable. The reſpect he ahd for Laides curb'd him from flying out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Dutcheſs; but the Duke <hi>d' Elbouf</hi> and he had ſuch high words together, that they had drawn their Swords if the Archduke had no pacifi'd 'em. The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> finding he could not revenge himſelf by his Sword, ſought out for otherways to plague the two perſons that had affronted him, and thought he could not find a better than to bring the Counteſs home to his Houſe and treat her there publickly as his Wife. This was the courſe he took, and from that time he liv'd with her very lovingly ſo long as ſhe remain'd at <hi>Bruſſels.</hi> But we muſt now return to <hi>France</hi> with the Duke of <hi>Orleance,</hi> who having obtain'd of the King to approve his Marriage, went to waite vpon him at St. <hi>Germains,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Madam.</p>

This Love however as innocent as it was, created a jealouſie in the Gardinal; and it ſeem'd to him ſo much the more dangerous and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to his favour, becauſe Madam <hi>de la Fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ette</hi> was in a ſtrict union with the Queen; and for that the Marchioneſs of <hi>Seneſay,</hi> a Lady of Honour, and the Queen's Creature, was the Confident entruſt d with the Secret. The Cardinal therefore us'd all his endeavours, to break that Union and at length obtain d an order from the King to baniſh thoſe two Ladies, which was carry'd to 'em by <hi>Cavig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> Secretary of State, and within a little while after, the Marquiſs of St. <hi>Ange,</hi> Maſter of the Queens Houſehold underwent the ſame deſgrace: Which very much incens'd the

                     </gap>ties, he was no leſs diſturb'd then before. Nevertheleſs, he durſt not openly aſſail the King's Paſſion, for fear of incurring his diſpleaſure, and putting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf out of favour; but to unhinge him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly from her, he thought it convenient to fix about him a Favorite depending in ſuch a manner upon his will, that he might ruin him when he was able to ſubſiſt of himſelf For that purpoſe the Cardinal caſt his eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Henry Deffiat,</hi> Marquiſs of St. <hi>Mars,</hi> Grand Squire of <hi>France,</hi> who had all the qualities re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to ſupply ſuch a Poſt. He was handſome, and genteel in his Addreſſes, but he lov'd his pleaſures to that degree, that there was all the probabilty imaginable that the fear of looſing the means of enjoyment would hinder him from attemping any thing upon the Credit of the Prime Miniſter. The King at firſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lik'd St. <hi>Mars</hi>'s licentious humour, which was abſolutely contrary to his reſerv'd way
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:53606:184"/> of living. However this Favorite, following the Cardinals advice, became ſo complaiſant that at length he vanquiſh'd the Kings relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctancy. For when the King made him any Preſents he beſought him to be ſpairing of his Favours, which would but create a jealouſie in Madam <hi>de Hautefort,</hi> and expoſe him to the darts of her revenge: and at laſt he ſo well manag'd his Maſter during his Journey to <hi>Chambort,</hi> that he drew a promiſe from him never to ſee Madam <hi>de Hautefort</hi> any more when he return'd to <hi>Paris.</hi> The Cardinal how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever afraid leaſt the King ſhould change his mind upon a freſh ſight of the Charming ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, left nothing omitted to keep him at a diſtance from her. He invented ſeveral pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to hinder him from returning to the Capital City of his Kingdom, and engag'd him in a tedious Journey to go and meet Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>Royale</hi> his Siſter as far as <hi>Grenoble,</hi> upon the Fronties of <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>emont.</hi> After this Interview, it was impoſſible to detain the King any longer in the Country, as being abſolutely reſolv'd to return to <hi>Paris.</hi> The Queen alſo went to meet him as far as <hi>Fontain Bleau,</hi> and carry'd Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Hautefort</hi> along with her. But the King's Paſſion for that Lady was accompani'd with ſo great a reſpect that he durſt not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low himſelf the leaſt liberty with her, as you may judge by what I ſhall tell ye. One day the Queen having receiv d a Billet, of which ſhe had a mind to make ſome kind of miſtery, plan'd it to the Hangings of her Chamber,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:53606:184"/> that ſhe might not forget to anſwer it; but the King coming in, within a little while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the Queen unwilling he ſhould ſee the Billet, commanded Madam <hi>de Hautefort,</hi> who was one of her Maids ot Honour, to take it down and lock it up which ſhe did according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The King would fain have taken it from her, and the King and ſhe contended together after a jeaſting manner; but at laſt Madam <hi>de Hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tefort,</hi> no longer able to defend her ſelf, clapt the Billet into her Boſom, a Sanctuary too ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure for him to meddle with: for the King durſt not touch it there, nor was he curious in the leaſt any more to ſee it. But tho the, King's Paſſion was accompani'd with great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervdneſs, never the leſs it was very nice and attended by jealouſie. For the King having a deſire to ſettle Madam <hi>de Hautefort</hi> in the World, reſolv'd to marry her to the Marquiſs <hi>de Gevres,</hi> Eldeſt Brother to the Duke <hi>de Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vres,</hi> at this day firſt Gentleman of the Chamber and Governor of <hi>Paris,</hi> who was no more at that time then an Abbot, and commanded her to receive him, as a perſon whom he deſign'd her for a Husband; which ſhe did without any conſtraint; for the Marquiſs was well ſhap'd, and had a very graceful preſence. Now while all things were preparing for this Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Beſig'd <hi>Corbie;</hi> and all the brave Gentlemen of the Court haſten'd to the relief of that place, and among the reſt the Marquiſs of <hi>Gevres,</hi> who was there ſlain; the news of which the King himſelf carry'd to
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:53606:185"/> Madam <hi>de Hautefort,</hi> and endeavour'd to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort her. Some few days after going into the ſame Ladies Chamber, he found her upon her knees before her little Altar, and ſtealing ſoftly behind her ſaw that ſhe was reading the Veſpers of the dead; upon which, imagining it was for the Marquiſs of <hi>Gevres,</hi> it ſeiz'd him with ſuch a ſit of jealouſie, that for ſix weeks to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, he would not ſo much as hear her name mention'd; tho he himſelf had propounded the Marriage of the Marquiſs to her: Which can be attributed to nothing elſe but the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priccios cuſtomary to Love, that frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly looks upon thoſe things which once it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd, as ſo many befallen miſchiefs.</p>
                  <p>At length Madam <hi>de Hautefort</hi> was brought into his Preſence by another Lady; but the King gave but a very cool Reception either to the one or the other; teling his Miſtreſs withal that ſhe had made unhappy. Jokes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on St. <hi>Mars.</hi>

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:53606:185"/> the King's paſſion ſhould re-kindle, by any longer frequenting her Company. To which purpoſe the prime Miniſter, and the Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite labour'd by conſert, and ſo ſedulouſly importun'd the King, that he ſent an Order to thoſe two Lady's to depart the Court forthwith; upon which they put themſelves into a Convent in <hi>Paris.</hi> But the Cardinal would not ſuffer 'em to harbour long there; enforcing Madam <hi>de Chennerault</hi> to retire into <hi>Poitou,</hi> and Madam de <hi>Hautefort</hi> to betake herſelf to one of her Houſes above forty Leagues from the Court.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Mar</hi>'s perceiving that no body had a greater ſhare in his Maſters Affections then himſelf, thought himſelf in a condition to aſpire to nobler Alliances. He had a long time Courted <hi>Marie de Gonzaga</hi> of whom we have already made mention, and had been ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate as to gain her Affection. Nay, report gave it out, that he had had a Daughter by her, of whom ſhe was privately brought to bed at the Marchioneſs <hi>d' Arquien</hi>'s Houſe, who was her Governeſs, and which afterwards went for her Daughter. St. <hi>Mars</hi> ſpoke to the Cardinal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout marrying this Princeſs; but he, afraid leaſt the Favourite ſhould become too powerful by means of that Allyance, refus'd to give his conſent, and ſo order'd it that the King quickly diſpos'd of her to another: <hi>Ladiſlaus</hi> the IV. King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> ſent to demand her in marriage, and the match was ſoon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. She carry'd along with her into <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
                     <pb n="138" facs="tcp:53606:186"/> Madam <hi>d' Arquten,</hi> together with the Daughter, which 'twas ſaid ſhe had by St. <hi>Mar</hi>'s. After the death of <hi>Ladiſtau</hi>'s the IV. ſhe marry'd in ſecond Wedlock <hi>Caſimir</hi> his Brother; and being no leſs deſirous to prefer the pretended Young Madam <hi>Darquien,</hi> ſhe marry'd her to a great Lord of <hi>Poland,</hi> and when ſhe came to be a Widow, to the Grand Marſhal <hi>Sobies<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean time, St. <hi>Mar</hi>'s, to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf amends for the loſs of his Miſtreſs, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd himſelf to <hi>Marion de Lorme,</hi> who in truth was but of a very obſcure extraction, but might well paſs for the moſt lovely Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in <hi>Europe;</hi> and as ſhe was none of the cruel ones, ſo was he ſoon happy. So ſoon as the King was in bed, away flew he from St. <hi>Gemains,</hi> and rode full ſpeed to meet her at <hi>Paris:</hi> and the delight which he took in her hindring him from riſing early in the morning, he was very rarely at the Kings ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. The King, who knew not the reaſon of his neglect, ask'd ſeveral of his Officers what was become of him but they ſaid not a word; whether out of ignorance, or whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were afraid to provoak a favourite. But <hi>La Chenaye,</hi> the Kings firſt Vaiet de <hi>Chambre,</hi> who had very much contributed to the putting his Miſtreſſes out of favour, finding that St. <hi>Mar</hi>'s never made him any grateful
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:53606:186"/> acknowledgment for what he had done, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd not to let ſo fair an opportunity of Revenge eſcape him. He knew that the King, who was extreamly reſerv'd in his Pleaſures, had an Averſion for thoſe that gave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves over to their Debaucheries; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thought he could not meet with a more certain expedient to plague the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite, then by acquainting his Maſter with his Love for <hi>Marion de Lorme,</hi> which he did: and faild not to infuſe into the King thoſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents which he was deſirous his Majeſty ſhould have of him. St. <hi>Mar</hi>'s perceiving the King's coldneſs toward him, fetch'd him about ſo many way's, that he made him confeſs the many ill Offices that Chenaye had done him. After the Count had diſcover'd from what hand the blow came, he ſtudy'd nothing but Revenge upon the Author of his diſgrace, and to ruin, ſo dangerous an Enemy in the good opinion of his Maſter. To that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he imparted his deſign to tha Marſhal <hi>de la Meilleraye,</hi> who had ſome reaſon likewiſe of diſguſt againſt the ſame Officer, and they were ſo aſſiduous in their endeavours to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade him, that they compaſs d their deſign. <hi>La Chenaye</hi> had ſome kind of preceding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Divination of his fall, and ſpoke of it to the Cardinal, who promis'd to ſupport him. But unfortunately for him, his Patron was then at his Houſe of <hi>Ruel,</hi> when the order was brought him to be gone, ſo that having
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:53606:187"/> no recourſe to his Eminency, he was forc'd to depart without delay.</p>
                  <p>The Cardinal was very much ſurpriz'd when he heard of <hi>Chenays</hi>'s being diſmiſs'd from his employment, and knowing that St. <hi>Mars</hi> was the author of it; he upbraided the Favourite with it, and told him, he never thought he would have remov'd a Perſon from the King's Perſon, whom he khew to be his Creature; and this too, in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and without his knowledge. St. <hi>Mars</hi> whoſe intereſt forbid him to quarrel with that Miniſter, while his Credit ſtood immovable, was conſtrain'd totall him all the particulars of the Intreague, and acknowledge his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for <hi>Marion de Lorme;</hi> and as it is a weakneſs in all Lovers to enhaunce the Charmes of their Miſtreſſes, he gave the Cardinal ſo lively a deſcription of her, that he infus d in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Cardinal a great deſier to ſee her.

                  <p>The Cardinal approv'd the Abbot of <hi>Bois Robert</hi>'s Project, and deſir'd him to looſe no time. Thereupon the Crafty Confident went the next day to give <hi>Ninon</hi> a Viſit, and made the match ſo dextrouſly, that <hi>Ninon,</hi> as cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nung as ſhe was, knew nothing of the deſign. The Cardinal having notice of the day, that the two Lady's were to come and ſee his Houſe, order'd a Magnificent Collation to be prepar'd ready in a little Iſland, in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Park, where he had alſo the King's Muſick, both Violins and Hautboy's; and all the Gallantry went under the Abbots name, the Lady's all that while not knowing any thing of the miſtery of the Banquet, which was carefully conceal'd from 'em. The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal alſo ſaw <hi>Marion de Lorme,</hi> without being ſeen himſelf, and found her a thouſand times handſomer then he imagin'd her to be. He had a deſire to know wheher ſhe had a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for St. <hi>Mars,</hi> and order'd <hi>Bois Robert</hi> to make the diſcovery. Tbe Abbot on the other ſide fail'd not to give his Eminency the ſatisfaction which he deſir'd, and gave him to underſtand that Vanity had a greater ſhare then Love in <hi>Marion de Lorme</hi>'s comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances with the King's Favourite; but that the Lady kept all her tenderneſs for <hi>Desbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaux,</hi> a Councellor in Parliament, a Young Gentlemen of a Graceful Meen, a lievely wit, and bonny Converſation but debauch'd and Irreligious to the higheſt degree. <hi>Richilieu</hi> order'd the Abbot to make a propoſal
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:53606:188"/> to <hi>Desbarreaux,</hi> that if he would part with his Miſtreſs to the Cardinal and engage her to correſpond with his Affection, he would be ſo far beholding to him for ſuch ah accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Sacrifice, that he would do for him whatever he deſir'd to advance his Fortute. <hi>Bois Robert</hi> diſcharg'd himſelf of his Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion with an extraordinary addreſs, but <hi>Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barreaux</hi> return'd him nothing but jocoſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, not believing the Cardinal could be guilty of ſo much weakneſs. Which incens d tne Prime Miniſter to that degree, that he perſecuted <hi>Desbarreaux</hi> as long as he liv'd, and forc'd him to fell his place and quit the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>After <hi>Deſbarreaux</hi> was gone, Madam <hi>des Enclos,</hi> at the requeſt of <hi>Bois Robert,</hi> ſpoke to her friend concerning the Cardinal's being in love with her; and the firſt overture of his Affection that he made her was accompani'd with a Preſent of a Pair of large Silver An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dirons, and a Candle-ſtick, which were va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lu'd at 20000 Livers. St. <hi>Mars</hi> ſurpriz'd to ſee this ornamental furniture in his Miſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Chamber, would needs know from whom ſo much liberality procecded, and not being able to clear the point from her own mouth, he let fall all his jealouſie upon <hi>Emeri,</hi> Controller of the <hi>Finances;</hi> who viſited her ſome times. Nay it made him ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>In the mean time St. <hi>Mars</hi>'s jealouſie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubl'd his paſſion for his Miſtreſs, whom he viſited every day and <hi>Incognith</hi> and in diſguiſe, not withſtanding the Kings Prohibitions.

Upon which the Ingratitude and Obſtinacy of this Favourtie ſo ſenſibly affected the King that he kept his Bed for ſome days, feigning himſelf ſick on purpoſe to avoid the ſight of that unthankful Officer, to whom he could not forbear ſhewing his reſentment.

'Tis true that the Death of the Count of <hi>Soiſons,</hi> which happen'd within a little while ater the Battle of <hi>Sedan,</hi> diſcompos'd this Conſpiracy for ſome time? but it was renew'd again with the Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> by the meanes of Madam <hi>de Thou.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:53606:189"/>
                  <p>After St. <hi>Mars</hi> was once engag'd in this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treague, he forgot to give intelligence to the Cardinal, as he was wont to do, of what the King ſaid of him, when he found any fault with his Miniſtry. On the other ſide, the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, who had plac'd that Favorite near the King s perſon, and had ſupported him in that Station, only to be a faithful Spy to inform him of his moſt ſecret thoughts, no ſooner ſaw him fail of his ſincerity, but he began to grow cold in his kindneſs for him, till at laſt thoſe reciprocal diſguſts degenerated into an irreconcileable hatred. One of the principal cauſes of St. <hi>Mars</hi>'s antipathy againſt the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, was his obſtructing the King's deſign to have made him one of his Privy Council. One day, at <hi>Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>el,</hi> as all the Courtiers were quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the King's Chamber, to leave it free for the chief Minſters, the King took St. <hi>Mars</hi> by the Arm, and ſtopping him, ſaid he to the Cardinal, 'tis neceſſary that our Friend (for ſo he call'd his Favorite) ſhould be well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in Our affairs, to the end he may be able to ſerve Us uſefully. The Cardinal, who was perfectly well acquainted with the King's humour, would not withſtand the King's deſign, but ſuffer d St. <hi>Mars</hi> to take his place in the Council; however he would not permit any matter of conſequence to be deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted there, and the next day being in private with his Majeſty, he neatly repreſented to him, how dangerous it would be to impart his ſecrets to ſo young a man as St. <hi>Mars,</hi>
                     <pb n="145" facs="tcp:53606:189"/> who might be eaſily wrought to reveal 'em. The King approv'd his Eminencies reaſons, and never after that, call'd his Favourite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Council. Which coming with eaſe to St. <hi>Mars</hi>'s ear, he could never be induc'd to pardon the Cardinal.</p>
                  <p>Upon that the Miniſter and the Favourite never afterwards obſerv'd any meaſures of Decorum, but diſplay'd their Hatred ſo pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly, that the King had much ado to keep 'em quiet. St. <hi>Mars</hi> being one day with the King, when a Gentleman who came from Marſhal <hi>de la Mothe,</hi> to bring his Majeſty the news of the Relief which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had put into <hi>Tarragon</hi> by Sea, endeavour'd to lay all the fault upon the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Bourde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aux,</hi> who commanded the <hi>French</hi> Fleet, this Favourite left nothing omitted to juſtifie the Archbiſhop, and blame the Marſhals conduct, who was a Kinſman of <hi>Noiers</hi> the Secretary of State, and conſequently the Cardinals Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Nor did he ſtop there, for under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that the Cardinal had accus'd him to the King, for having ſhew'd but little Courage at the Siege of <hi>Arras,</hi> where he commanded the Voluntiers, he ſlyly put it into the King's Head, finding him enclin'd to Peace, that the Cardinal prolong'd the War for his own particular ends, and ſtarted every day new obſtacles to hinder an Accomodation of the differences between the two Crowns. In ſhort he omitted nothing to put his Majeſty out of conceite with the Cardinal. And the little
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:53606:190"/> kindneſs which the King ſhew'd the Cardinal for ſome days, afforded St. <hi>Mars,</hi> whoſe Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation was plainly diſcern'd to increaſe, as the Cardinal began to wain and looſe his Maſters favour, a means to draw to his party ſeveral perſons whom it would have been in vain for him to have attempted at any other time.</p>
                  <p>The Cardinal, on the other ſide, who had notice of all theſe practices, engag'd the King to leave <hi>Paris</hi> in order to beſiege <hi>Perpignan</hi> himſelf, and compleat the conqueſt of <hi>Rouſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> in hopes that the cares of the War would divert the King from familiar Diſcourſes, at what time his Minions took their opportunity to cry down his Miniſtry. This Journey in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd a Jealouſie into St. <hi>Mars,</hi> who fearing leaſt the Cardinal during the Campaign, ſhould work himſelf again into the King's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and make uſe of it to his ruin, deem'd it convenient to ſecure a place of refuge for himſelf. Nor could he think of any more convenient then <hi>Sedan,</hi> the Soveraignty of which City belong'd to the Duke of <hi>Bouillon.</hi> He opend his mind to Madam <hi>de Thou,</hi> who promis'd him to obtain from the Duke all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite Aſſurances of the Sanctuary which he deſir'd. In ſhort, he went to wait upon the Duke at <hi>Sedan,</hi> to perſwade him to come to <hi>Paris;</hi> and he got thither at the ſame time that the Duke was preſs'd by the Cardinal to undertake the ſame Journey, to receive his Commiſſion for command of the Army in <hi>Italy,</hi> which the King intended to confer up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:53606:190"/> him. The Duke finding himſelf ſolicited on both ſides, ſet forward at length and went to Court; and was at firſt at a great puzzle which party to adhear to, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which would be moſt for his advantage to joyn with the Cardinal of the Favourite. But at length his inveterate Hatred againſt the Cardinal, and the perſwaſions of Madam <hi>de Thou,</hi> over-rul'd him to engage with St. <hi>Mars.</hi> However he did not refuſe the Command of the Army in <hi>Italy:</hi> and they drew from him a promiſe that he ſhould<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> admit into <hi>Sedan</hi> the King's Brother, who had already declar'd himſelf head of the Party. But in regard there were ſeveral particulars that were to be agreed upon, they aſſign'd the <hi>Hoſtel de Veniſe</hi> for the place of their <hi>Rendevouz,</hi> where Monſieur had his Stables. There, met St. <hi>Mars,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> who ſent for the Counts of <hi>Aubijoux, de Brion,</hi> and <hi>de Fonterailles.</hi> There, it was propos d whither they ſhould put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under the Protection of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> upon which there happen'd great Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes: but at laſt it paſt in the Affirmative. <hi>Fonterailles</hi> was entruſted with that Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by reaſon of his Addreſs and Cunning. Beſides that being not ſo conſiderable for his Quality, as the reſt, it was to be preſum'd, that his abſence from Court would be the leſs taken notice off. 'Twas a good while before he would undertake the buſineſs; but at length away he went, and arrived at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid,</hi> concluded a Treaty with the <hi>Duke d' Olivarez,</hi> the Catholick King's chief Miniſter

                  <p>During the King's Expedition, St. <hi>Mars</hi> inſtead of preſerving the Kings friendſhip by complying with him, did all that he could do to looſe it: ſo far from cloſing with his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, that he made it his buſineſs ſtill to thwart him: and when his Majeſty deſir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But St <hi>Mars</hi> who thought of nothing ſo much as the death of the Cardinal took no notice of the King's growing diſaffection, imagining it would be eaſie for him to regain his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters favour, if once he were rid of his Enemy.

But becauſe it was a difficult thing to ſecure all the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators in the Army, the King return'd to <hi>Narbonne,</hi> pretending himſelf ſick of an Ague, of which he had already had ſome fits. So ſoon as he arriv'd there, he caus'd the Gates to be ſhut, and gave all requiſite Orders for the ſeizing all thoſe that had any ſhare in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy. <hi>Fonterailles</hi> had already made his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape ſome days before, ſhrewdly ſuſpecting that the Treaty was diſcover'd. To which purpoſe he had feign'd a Quarrel with the Camp-Marſhal <hi>d' Epernon;</hi> to the end that when his flight ſhould be known, it might be imagin'd, that he was only ſtept aſide to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the Rigour of Juſtice which puniſh d Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els very ſeverely.

                  <p>This occaſion'd a pleaſant Story. She had by the Marquiſs a pretty young Lad to her Son, who began to learn Latin, and one day it came into her head to ask his Maſter, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Boy were likely to be a Schollar.

                  <p>This was the poſture of the Court of <hi>France,</hi> when all the Exiles were recall'd.

<pb n="161" facs="tcp:53606:197"/> 
                     <hi>Meſdames de Senelay</hi> and <hi>Hautefort,</hi> were reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to their places, and the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> who had quitted <hi>Bruſſells,</hi> came to pay his vows to Madam <hi>de Monbaſon.</hi> The Dutcheſs of <hi>Cheuvreuſe,</hi> who was one of the Gang at the ſame time, appear'd at the <hi>Louvre,</hi> but was coldly receiv'd by the Queen, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to withdraw to <hi>Dampierre,</hi> not that ſhe had any real deſign to baniſh her, but ſhe would have her be beholding to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal for her being reſtor'd into Favour, that ſhe might be oblig d to live amicably with him. In ſhort, he went to ſee her the next day, and gave her five and twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Crowns and made her great offers of his Service. Immediately the Dutcheſs put him upon the proof of his ſincerity, by demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two very important things of him. The one, that he ſhould ſatisfie the Duke of <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> for his pretentions to the Government of <hi>Bretagne,</hi> in reference to which, he had as yet been only fed with words: and the next was, that the Duke of <hi>Epernon</hi> ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor d to his Emploment of Collonel of Foot, and his Government of <hi>Guinne.</hi> The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal carri'd himſelf in both very obligingly, and offer'd the Duke of <hi>Vendome</hi> the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty, in lieu of his Government. The Duke of <hi>Epernon</hi> was reſtor'd to all his Honours, and nothing was omitted to get the Government of <hi>Guienne</hi> out of the Count <hi>de Harcourt</hi>'s hands. Madam <hi>de Cheuvreuſe,</hi> after ſhe had obtain'd theſe two Favours, demanded a
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:53606:198"/> third, which the Cardinal at firſt was very unwilling to grant, but at length he gave his conſent. This was, that he would confer the Government of <hi>Havre de Grace</hi> upon the Prince of <hi>Marſillac,</hi> whom ſhe had a deſire to engage effectually in her Intereſts. After two ſuch notable Tryals of her skill, ſhe thought it impoſſible for that ſame Prime Miniſter to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny her any thing; and therefore ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to him the reſtoration of Madam <hi>de Chaſtetau-Neuf:</hi> but in regard he could not conſent to it without prejudice to his own particular intereſts, he abſolutely refus'd to gratifie her: which occaſion'd a Rupture; ſo that afterwards there was never any ſincere correſpondence or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation between 'em. <hi>Chaſteau-Neuf</hi> had been for ſome time already at <hi>Monrouge,</hi> where he happen'd to arrive the ſame day that the Dutcheſs return'd to <hi>Paris</hi> by another Roade. And perhaps if he had not ſtopt there, but had come directly to Court without capitulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Queen, he had oblig'd her by that frankneſs to have ſtuck cloſe to him. But being deſirous to follow the example of Madam <hi>de Senſay,</hi> who refus'd to return to <hi>Paris,</hi> till ſhe was reſettl'd in her Employment, he gave the Queen time to underſtand his temper, without deſiring his nearer approach. But his caſe was not the ſame with that of Madam <hi>de Senſay,</hi> who had no body to oppoſe her but a perſon for whom the Queen had no kindneſs,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:53606:198"/> whereas <hi>Chaſtau-Neuf,</hi> beſides that Monſieur the Prince's whole Family oppos'd him, gave an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of jealouſie to the Prime Miniſter, and had no other way but by Addreſſes and by degrees to gain what the Lady of Honour obtain'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her firſt motion. The Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi> alſo loſt himſelf by the ſame error; for he thought the Queen ſo prepoſſeſs'd with an affection to him, that he imagin'd he might be able to ruin <hi>Mazarin,</hi> by ſhewing himſelf ſomewhat cold to that ſame Princeſs. But that behaviour of his, alter'd all the meaſures that had been taken for his advancement. He had been already in nomination for a Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals Cap; but when it was ſeen, that he ſhew'd ſo little acknowledgment, orders were ſent away privately to <hi>Rome,</hi> to deſiſt from any farther ſollicitation in his behalf. Neither did the Duke of <hi>Vendome,</hi> his Father, carry himſelf with more prudence: for he ſcrupl'd to accept of the Office of High-Admiral with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Anchorage, not conſidering, that it became him firſt of all, at any rate, to have worm'd himſelf into the Employment, and then he might eaſily afterwards have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended his Priviledges. He was ſo much at variance with himſelf what courſe to take, that he made his addreſſes ſometimes to the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and acknowledg'd himſelf beholding to him for his Preferment; the next moment he ſought an opportunity to get the Marſhal <hi>d' Etrees</hi> to ſpeak to <hi>de la Riviere,</hi> and conjure him to bring about his deſigns: and no ſooner
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:53606:199"/> was he out of his ſight, but he endeavour d by indirect ways to engage Monſieur the Prince to ſerve him. In ſhort, there was hardly an hour paſt over his head, but he chang'd both his ſentiments and his Party.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi> therefore ſeeing his meaſures broken by the removal of <hi>Chaſteau-Neuf,</hi> reſolv'd to rid himſelf of the Cardinal, and ſubordain'd certain perſons to kill him, as he went to the <hi>Palace Royal,</hi> where the Queen then lay, or elſe as he return'd. But the Cardinal having an inkling of what was contriving againſt him, immediatly went to the <hi>Palace Royal,</hi> tho he knew the Queen was not there, and ſent for all his friends. The Duke of <hi>Beaufort,</hi> who narrowly watch'd him, took notice of the ſwarm he had got about him, and rightly gueſt from thence, that his project had taken air, which oblig'd him to defer the execution of it till the next day, when he might have a better op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, as he believ'd, becauſe the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal was to go that day to <hi>Maiſons,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to paſs by the <hi>Hoſtle de Vendome.</hi> However he was ſtill diſappointed: for the Cardinal meeting the Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi> by the way, the Duke took him into his Coach, and the reſpect which they bore to the King's Uncle, hinder'd the Conſpirators from mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any attempt. In the Mean time the Queen being inform'd of the Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi>'s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, caus d him to be arreſted and ſent him away Priſoner to the Caſtle of <hi>Vincennes.</hi>

Thereupon the Dutcheſs was wrought to declare in the Queen's preſence to the two Princeſſes, that ſhe had no ſhare in ſpreading the reports, and that ſhe utterly diſown'd 'em. On the other ſide, the two Princeſſes as it had been agreed upon before, declar'd that they were willing to believe her, becauſe Madam <hi>de Monbaſon</hi> ſaid it. It was alſo convenanted by

<pb n="169" facs="tcp:53606:201"/> not taken it away from the Painter: in the mean time the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> happen'd to go by chance to the Painters houſe, where he ſaw the Picture, and was ſo charm'd with it, that he put it in his Poket, and carri'd it away notwithſtanding all that the Painter could ſay to him, only he was ſo juſt as to pay him thirty Piſtoles for his work. The Picture in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd a deſire into him to make his addreſſes to the Original; he diſcours'd <hi>Mademoiſelle de Pons;</hi> diſcover'd his Paſſion to her; and was ſo aſſidous in his addreſſes, that he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peirc'd the greateſt part of her Lovers.

                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Joyeuſe</hi> made his addreſſes to <hi>Mademoiſelle de Guerchi,</hi> a great Companion of Madam <hi>de Pons</hi>'s, who ſacrific'd him aferwards to the Commander <hi>de Jars,</hi> of the Houſe of <hi>Roche Chouard.</hi> The Duke therefore to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng d of his Brother for depriving him of his former Miſtreſs, endeavour d to put a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable Rival upon him, and to that intent ſo highly cri'd up the Charms of Madam <hi>de Pons</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Orleance,</hi> that he ſet him a gog to get the ſole poſſeſſion of her. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently he became her moſt diligent Servant, and for ſome time was a great diſturbance to the Duke of <hi>Guiſe;</hi> who underſtanding that his
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:53606:202"/> Brother had rais'd him up that Rival to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex him, endeavour'd to pay him in his own Coyn. Underſtanding therefore that the Duke of <hi>Joyeuſe</hi> made his addreſſes to <hi>Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moeſelle de St. Megrin,</hi> who was alſo one of the Queen's Maids of Honour, he perſwaded that Lady that Monſieur was in Love with her, and knowing there was to be a Ball within an Evening or two at the Regents Lodgings, he deſir'd her in Monſieur's name to give him a Blew Ribband that ſhe wore upon her Sleive, aſſuring her that the Duke deſir'd to wear that favour of hers when he came to the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The Lady being eaſily entreated gave <hi>Guiſe</hi> the Ribband, who preſently carri'd it Monſieur, and requeſted him in the Ladies name to wear it that Evening at the Ball, which he did accordingly. After which, to Monſieur, who began to be a weary of the great croud that uſually environ'd Madam <hi>de Pons,</hi> left her, and ſtuck to Mad. <hi>de St. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grin,</hi> who had not ſo numerous a throng about her, and by that means deliver'd the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> from the vexation of his Rival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
                  <p>The time being come for the Army to take the Field, the Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi> went to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Army in <hi>Flanders;</hi> and was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pani d thither by the greateſt part of the Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tl'd Nobility that belong'd to the Court. The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> and Marquiſs of <hi>Villequiers</hi> went as Voluntiers; and at the ſame time, to give proofs of their Valour and their love for their
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:53606:202"/> Miſtreſſes, they reſolv'd at the Siege of <hi>Dix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mude,</hi> to venture ſo far in the Trenches, that whoever of the two loſt his life, the ſurvivour might be ſo happy as to enjoy Mad. <hi>de Pons</hi> without a Rival. The ſame day the Beſieg'd made a Salley, where the two Lovers gave ſignal marks of their Courage, but tho neither the one nor the other were any way ſparing of their perſons, yet they both came off without ſo much as being wounded. Upon which, the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> who was very ſincere, wrote a Letter to Mad. <hi>de Pons,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he highly extoll'd the undaunted Bravery of his Rival.</p>
                  <p>When they reurn'd from the Campaign, the Court remov'd to <hi>Fontain Bleau,</hi> where hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd a great quarrel who ſhould have the King's Muſick, which <hi>Villequier</hi> had beſpoke to give Madam <hi>de Pons</hi> an entertainment upon the <hi>Canal,</hi> and which the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> would have had for the ſame deſign: inſomuch that the Queen was forc'd to make uſe of her au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to deſide the difference. There alſo happen'd another quarrel between the Duke and Marſhal <hi>Schomburg,</hi> about a certain Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poon which had been made upon the Queens Maids of Honour, wherein the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> was ſeverely nipt; and Copies were carri'd to him under the hand of the Marſhal's Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary; which was the reaſon that the Maſter was accus'd to be the Author.</p>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:53606:203"/>
                  <p>But the Duke <hi>d' Elbeauf</hi> having notice of the quarrel, made up the buſineſs, and reconcil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 'em. However the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> being deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to free himſelf from the competition of all his Revals, begg'd leave of the Queen that he might Court his Miſtreſs upon the account of Matrimony; which having obtain d, he ſent to her Chamber her Dyet ready dreſt from his own Houſe, and order'd his own Officers to attend her, which created an extraordinary jealouſie among his Competitours.</p>
                  <p>1645. But becauſe the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> could not marry Madam <hi>de Pons,</hi> till he had diſſolv'd his Marriage with the Counteſs of <hi>Boſſu,</hi> he reſolv'd to go to <hi>Rome,</hi> to Proſecute the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce before the Tribunal of the <hi>Ruota.</hi> The Action alſo was already commenc'd, and his Mother ſent two Gentlemen thither to far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it. But when ſhe underſtood her Son's Affection for Madam <hi>de Pons,</hi> ſhe ſent to her Agent to deſiſt. At length the Duke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf departed, and after he had eſcap'd the dangers of the Sea, arriv'd ſafely at <hi>Florence,</hi> where he oblig'd the Grand Duke to write in his behalf to <hi>Innocent</hi> X. then newly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd to the <hi>Pontificate.</hi> When he arriv'd at <hi>Rome,</hi> he was kindly receiv'd by the <hi>Pope,</hi> who alſo at his requeſt, granted the Cardinals Cap to <hi>Mazarins</hi> Brother. For the Duke was in hopes that ſuch a Piece of Service would have engag'd the Prime Miniſter to have fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd his Deſign; but he was ſo far from it
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:53606:203"/> that the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſador had Order to croſs and fruſtrate his Proceedings.</p>
                  <p>After the Departure of the Prince, <hi>Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle de Pons,</hi> not being ſatisfy d with her uſage at Court, retir'd to the Convent of <hi>Chaſſemidi,</hi> where her Lovers Officers wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon her every day, in the Houſe belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Convent, whether ſhe went at the Hours of Dinner and Supper through a long Gallery which joyn'd the ſeperate Apartment and the Convent together. On the other ſide the Duke being inform'd of her Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, lent an Ear to a Propoſal that <hi>Touti</hi> made him to put himſelf into <hi>Naples</hi> and command the Army of the Rebels. He wrote therefore to the Cardinal to give him notice of this Propoſal, and having obtain'd leave, he Embarqu'd in a Shallop, and paſſing through the midſt of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet, got ſafe into <hi>Naples,</hi> where he met with great difficulties to be ſurmounted. For before his Arrival, the ſole Authority was in the hands of <hi>Jennaro,</hi> who was no more then a Sword-Cutler at firſt, but he was conſtrain'd at laſt to give way to the Duke. So ſoon as the Duke had the Power in his Hands, he forbid any more Plundring of Houſes, which <hi>Jenuaro,</hi> ſuffer'd every day, to enrich himſelf. Upon which, that Brute of a Commander conceiv d ſo great an Enmity againſt the Duke, that he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver after pardon him, but joyning with the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate moſt popular among the Revolters, and no leſs vex d then himſelf to miſs his
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:53606:204"/> ſhare of the Plunder, they both together fram'd ſeveral contrivances againſt the Dukes Life. Beſides, he had neither Proviſion nor Amunition in the City, nor money to buy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: for that, the Captain of the Rebels, till then, had mentain'd his Men by the Plunder of the Houſes only; ſo that the Duke was conſtrain'd to ſupply all his Exigencies by his own Credit. For he receiv'd no Succor from <hi>France,</hi> becauſe the Cardinal imagin'd, as it was true enough, that the Duke had a deſign to make himſelf King of <hi>Naples,</hi> that he might ſet a Crown upon the Head of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demoiſelle de Pons.</hi> The Kings Fleet that came to an Anchor before the <hi>Haven</hi> of the City, ſerv'd to no other purpoſe but to debaſe his Reputation among the people, becauſe they brought neither Men nor Ammunition. Yet for all theſe diſſaſters, nothing abated the Dukes Courage nor leſſend his Affection for his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs. For after he had driven the <hi>Spaniards</hi> from their Principal Poſts, and taken diverſe conſiderable Priſoners, he thought he might then act like a King; ſo that he ſent a Procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to the Marquiſs of <hi>Brancas,</hi> his Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to marry <hi>Mademoiſelle de Pons</hi> in his name.</p>
                  <p>The Marquiſs inform'd the Cardinal of all this, who to aſſure himſelf of the Dukes Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, thought it convenient to ſhut up <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demoiſelle de Pons</hi> in a Convent, whether ſhe was ſent by the Queen's Order. But the Lady having notice of the deſign againſt her
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:53606:204"/> Liberty reſolv'd to fly with two of her Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, to whom ſhe had imparted the reaſon of the Alarums, and who had promiſ'd both to facilitate her flight, and to bear her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. Thereupon ſhe ſtole out of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, leaving behind her the two Maids that were wont to attend her; but ſhe got no farther then St. <hi>Clou.</hi> For the two Lovers not being able to agree among themſelves who ſhould have the greateſt ſhare in her, advis'd her to return to the Convent.</p>
                  <p>All this while they had been ſo long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending one with another, till it was Night, and the Nunns were retir'd to their Cells: nevertheleſs, her Maids having notice of her return, caus'd the Gates of the Convent to be open'd, pretending their was a Courrier ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd from the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> that was to ſpeak with their Miſtreſs. By which means ſhe got into the Houſe where he was accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom'd to eat, and ſo return d to her Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without any diſcovery being made of her abſence.</p>
                  <p>However the Queen who had ſome inkling of her Eſcape, had ſent, whlle ſhe was at St. <hi>Clou,</hi> to the Convent an Exempt of the Guards of the Body to know whether ſhe were there or no, and to ſpeak with her. Upon which one of her Maids that moſt reſembl'd her in tallneſs and ſhape, came to the Grate of the ſpeaking-place with her face wrapt in her Handkerchif, feigning to have the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oothach. The Exempt brought back word again to the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:53606:205"/> Queen that he had ſpoken to a certain Perſon that was like her, but could not ſay it 'twast <hi>Mademoiſelle de Pons,</hi> becauſe he could not ſee her Face. The Queen therefore ſent the next day the Dutcheſſes of <hi>Eguillon</hi> and <hi>Lyancourt</hi> with Orders to carry her to the Convent of Nunns, of the Viſitation of the Holy Virgin in St. <hi>Anthonies</hi> Street; which they did with ſo much ſeverity, that they would neither ſuffer her to take her Maids along with her, nor to ſpeak with any body. Of all which ſhe inform d the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> by a Letter, who wrought with ſo much vehemence back again to the Queen and the Cardinal, that for fear of exaſperating his diſpaire, and forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to treat with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they ſet <hi>Mademoiſelle de Pons</hi> at liberty, and gave her leave to retire to <hi>Angloiſes</hi> upon St. <hi>Victor's</hi> Mote, where ſhe was viſited by all her Friends.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Year there fell out another Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident which had like to have reviv'd the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient feuds between the Houſes of <hi>Bourbon</hi> and <hi>Lorrain.</hi> The Marquiſs of <hi>Chabet</hi> a Favourite of Monſieur the Prince, had marry'd the Heir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs of the Houſe of <hi>Rohan</hi> without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Dutcheſs of <hi>Rohan</hi> her Mother, who to be reveng'd of her, ſet up a Brother, of whom as ſhe ſaid, ſhe lay in privately at <hi>Paris</hi> the 18 of <hi>December</hi> 1630, upon her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from <hi>Paris,</hi> in the preſence only of two Women and her Apothecary. She pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alſo that ſhe had caus'd him to be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd under Counterfeit Names, becauſe her
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:53606:205"/> Husband was then at variance with the Court, that ſhe had nam'd him <hi>Tancrede,</hi> and that ſhe had caus'd him to be bred up by a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of her acquaintance, call'd <hi>Mademoiſelle Millet.</hi> That the Duke of <hi>Rhoan,</hi> returning to <hi>Paris</hi> in 1634, ſaw this Son of his ſeveral times with great ſatisfaction. That the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> having taken <hi>Corbie</hi> in 1636. and the <hi>Pariſians</hi> having taken the Alarum, ſhe ſent away <hi>Tancrede</hi> into <hi>Normandy,</hi> to the Father of <hi>Temon,</hi> her Steward to ſecure his Perſon, till ſhe could take him along with her out of <hi>France.</hi> That this Son was ſtolen away by people unknown the 2d of <hi>February</hi> 1638. That ſeven Years after, ſhe diſcover'd that <hi>Tancrede</hi> had been ſtollen away by the order of <hi>Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle de Rohan,</hi> and carri'd to <hi>Leyden,</hi> in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> where his Penſion was paid to a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant by his Siſter. However it were, the Dutcheſs of <hi>Rohan</hi> ſent for this Son, whether real or ſuppoſed to <hi>Paris,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> at the Requeſt of M. <hi>de Pons,</hi> who was a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar friend of the Dutcheſſes, went to meet him, took him into his Coach, carry'd him to his Houſe, and declar'd himſelf his Protector, while Monſieur the Prince with great heat ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported <hi>Chabet</hi>'s Intereſt; but <hi>Tancrede</hi> was kill d in the Civil Wars, and ſo put an end to that Controverſie.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> underſtanding what ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect his Letters had produc'd, reſolv'd to make one fair puſh for it, to open the Paſſages and make way for Proviſions to come to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:53606:206"/> To which purpoſe he went and laid Siege to a little Iſland within a League of <hi>Naples,</hi> and within a few hours reduced the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> that were in the Fort to Capitulate. Now in regard the place was not to be deliver'd till the next day, the Duke was forc'd to ſtay there all Night, and in that time <hi>Gennaro,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the chief Magiſtrate of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the reſt of the Dukes Enemies, ſign'd the Treaty which they had made with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and deliver'd the Principal Poſts of tne City into their hands. So that when the Duke would have return'd, he found the Gates ſhut, and an Enemy fireing upon him. He ſought then to make his Eſcape with ſome Squadrons that ſtook to him, but all the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes were ſo well guarded that he was forc'd to yeild himſelf a Priſoner. <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria,</hi> who at that time commanded the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Army in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> after he had kept him ſome for time in the Caſtle of <hi>Puzzuolo,</hi> ſent him to <hi>Segovià</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> where he remain'd ſome years, and ran a great hazard of his Life, becuſe he had not been own'd by <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>During his Impriſonment, <hi>Mademoiſelle de Pons</hi> became unfaithful to him; for having at a Ball at <hi>Chauron</hi> the Preſidents Wife's Houſe, beheld <hi>Malicorne,</hi> the Chavalier <hi>de Hautefort's</hi> Brother, who ſeated himſelf at her Feet to diſcourſe of Love, ſhe took an Affection to him, and forgot all that the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> had done for her. However, this Paſſion was thwarted by <hi>Malicorm</hi>'s Family, who did all

So that there was only <hi>Mademoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle de Guerchi</hi> that could not meet with a Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. She had quitted the Commander <hi>de Jaret,</hi> wholly to give her ſelf up to <hi>Jeannin</hi> of <hi>Caſtille,</hi> the King's Treaſurer, and ſhe carry'd herſelf with ſo little reſerv'dneſs, that the Queen ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd her the Court. However the Duke of <hi>Vitry,</hi> engag d with her for all that, and treated her with as much reſpect as if ſhe had been a <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretia,</hi> tho' ſhe had had four or five Children by ſeveral Fathers. More then that, ſhe grew with Child a ſixth time, and the Duke being deſirous
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:53606:207"/> to preſerve her Reputation, which he would not believe to be quite ſo much loſt as it was, nothing would ſerve his turn but that ſhe muſt come before her Time. 'Twas in vain to cry, ſhe ſhould be overjoy'd to have ſuch a Pledge of their Friendſhip; he was abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd ſhe ſhould deſtroy the fruit of their A<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mours, and ſent her a Midwife, whoſe name was <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> who would needs deliver her by force: but ſhe dy'd in the Operation, and <hi>Conſtantine</hi> was hang d. The Duke of <hi>Vitry</hi> was a long time a comfortleſs bemoaner of her death, and preſerv'd the Memory of her ſo charily, that he afterwards engag d him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with a common Harlot, becauſe the Strum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet reſembl'd her. And that Woman being enrich'd by his Liberality, marry'd afterwards the Marquiſs of <hi>Goudron,</hi> a younger Brother to the Houſe of <hi>Gamache.</hi>

                  <p>1649. The Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi> having made his Eſcape out of the Caſtle of <hi>Vincennes,</hi> enter'd into a new League with the Princes of the Houſe of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> the Parliament and the People who had taken Arms upon the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment of the Preſident <hi>Blanc-Menil,</hi> and <hi>Brouſſel</hi> a Councellor in the ſame Body; which enforc'd the Queen to beſiege <hi>Paris.</hi> Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur the Prince, who then adhear'd to her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts commanded the King's Army, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd the Mutineers to Capitulate.

And when the Court return'd from that Expedition, Monſieur, who had ſuffer'd himſelf to be gain'd by the Cardinals Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies who were then call'd <hi>Slingers,</hi> ſolicited ſo powerfully for the Liberty of the Princes, that they were conſtrain'd to grant him their Releaſe, and the Cardinal himſelf was forc'd to depart the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>When the Queen ſaw the Princes at Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſhe endeavour'd to regain the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and by the meditation of the Princeſs <hi>Palatin,</hi> offer'd him the Government of <hi>Guy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onne</hi> for himſelf, and that of <hi>Province</hi> for the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:53606:208"/> Prince of <hi>Conti,</hi> provided he would not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Cardinals return, and that he would break off the Marriage of his Brother with <hi>Mademoiſelle de Cheuvreuſe,</hi> which was one of the Conditions upon which the <hi>Slingers</hi> had intereſted themſelves in obtaining his Liberty. This negotiation was kept very private, and tho the <hi>Slingers</hi> preſs'd very earneſtly for the Conſumation of the Marriage, the Dutcheſs of <hi>Longueville</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Rochefoucaut</hi> left nothing omitted to croſs it, for fear the Prince of <hi>Conti,</hi> ſhould eſcape their hands, and joyn with the Dutcheſs of <hi>Cheuvreuſe</hi> and <hi>Gondi</hi> Coadjutor of <hi>Paris.</hi> Monſieur the Prince was overjoy'd that thoſe two Perſons aſſiſted him in his deſignes without any neceſſity of putting himſelf to the trouble; which made him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to augment the jealouſies which the <hi>Slingers</hi> had conceiv'd of his Siſter, and the Duke of <hi>Rochefoucaut.</hi> However they forbore not to ſend to <hi>Rome</hi> in order to obtain a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation upon the account of Conſanguinity, and the Prince of <hi>Conti</hi> waited impatiently for it, becauſe the Perſon of <hi>Mademoiſelle de Cheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vreuſe</hi> particularly pleas'd him, and for that he would have been glad to have quitted the Cauſe of the Church, which they had forc'd him to embrace againſt his will. However he conceal'd his laſt thoughts from his friends with all the Artifice he was capable of, and chiefly from Madam <hi>de Longueville,</hi> as being deſirous ſhe ſhould believe that he acted only upon the ſcore of Love.</p>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:53606:208"/>
                  <p>In the midſt of theſe perplexities, he pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately requeſted the Preſident <hi>Viole,</hi> who was to draw up the Articles of the Marriage, to yield to all the points that ſhould be conteſted, and to ſurmount all difficulties. During this Negotiation, the Queen took the Seals from <hi>Chateau-Neuf,</hi> and gave 'em to <hi>Matthew Mole,</hi> firſt Preſident of the Parliament, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd the diſtruſts of Madam <hi>de Cheuvreuſe</hi> about the Marriage which ſhe ſo-earneſtly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd for, becauſe it was upon the Credit of that Miniſter that ſhe had grounded all her hopes of procuring to Monſieur the Prince the Eſtabliſhment for which ſhe had engag'd her ſelf, and which was to have been ratifi'd at the ſame time that the Marriage was ſolemniz'd. The only thing that chear'd her up was the Prince of <hi>Contis,</hi> extraordinary Paſſion for her. He paid her a thouſand obſequious vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits, which he conceal'd from his friends, and more eſpecially from his Siſter, and had very long and private Conferences with <hi>L'aygues,</hi> and <hi>Marmontieres,</hi> of which, contrary to his cuſtome, he never gave an account to any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. In ſhort, his conduct appear'd ſo extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, that the Preſident <hi>Nemond,</hi> the Prince or <hi>Conde</hi>'s particular creature, thought himſelf oblig'd to give him notice of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers deſign, and told him that he was going about to marry the Dutcheſs of <hi>Cheuvreuſe,</hi> without either diſpenſation, or letting any body know it; that he hid himſelf from all his friends to treat with <hi>L'aygues,</hi> and that
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:53606:209"/> if he did not ſpeedily put a ſtop to it, he would ſee the Prince of <hi>Conti</hi> taken from him by the Datcheſs of <hi>Cheuvreuſe,</hi> and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage conſummated at a time when people thought he had moſt reaſon to prevent it. This fair warning, ſettl d his wavering thoughts, ſo that without any farther conſultation away he went to the Prince of <hi>Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ti,</hi> and began his diſcourſe with joking upon the vehemency of his Love; but he concluded it with talking of <hi>Mademoiſelle de Cheuveruſe,</hi> the Coadjutor <hi>Nourmoutier</hi> and <hi>Commartin</hi> whatever he thought moſt prevalent to diſguſt a Lover or a Husband. Nor did he meet with any great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in bringing about his deſign, whether it were that the Prince of <hi>Conti</hi> thought he ſpoke truth, or that he durſt not make any ſhew of miſdoubting it. He thankt him therefore for his wholeſome advice, and took a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion never to think of the Dutcheſs more; he alſo blam'd the Dukes of <hi>Longuoville</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chefoucaui,</hi> for not informing him ſooner of what the World ſaid of her. From that time forward they ſought to break off the match without imbitterment on either ſide, but the Intereſts were too great, and the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances too hard to be digeſted, for any body to think they could produce any other ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, then an abſolute reviving and reinflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the old Grudges, which the Duthceſs of <hi>Cheuvreuſe</hi> and the <hi>Slingers</hi> bare the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> whom they ſuſpected to haye had a ſhare in the Rupture.</p>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:53606:209"/>
                  <p>However the Preſident <hi>Viole</hi> was order'd to viſit the Dutcheſs of <hi>Cheuvreuſe,</hi> to diſingage the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> and <hi>Conti,</hi> with ſome ſort of Decorúm and good Manners from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes they had made and broken in reference to the Marriage. The next day after both the one and the other were to pay her a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle viſit: but whither it were that they could not put that force upon themſelves as to wait upon a perſon to whom they knew their company would be altogether unwellcome, or that the two Brothers, who fell out every day upon the moſt trivial occaſions, could not agree about the manner of paying this viſit, neither they, nor the Preſident <hi>Viole</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd the intended Ceremony. So that the affair broke off on their ſide without obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any meaſures, or any way endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to juſtifie what they had done. As for <hi>Mademoiſelle de Cheuvreuſe</hi> ſhe was ſo affected at this ſame alteration of the Princes humour, that ſhe threw her ſelf into a Carmalite Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery, where ſhe took the habbit upon her ſoon after.</p>
                  <p>But the breaking off this Marriage, which it was thought would have reunited the Prince and the Queen together, wrought a contrary effect. For the Queen imagin'd by dividing the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> and Madam <hi>de Cheuvreuſe</hi> to have united the <hi>Slingers</hi> to the Cardinals intereſts, and that things would have been in the ſame condition as they were when the three Princes were arreſted. But ſeveral dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:53606:210"/> Intereſts ſpurr'd on the Prince of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de</hi> to break off with the Court: he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf no longer ſafe with the Queen, and was afraid of relapſing into a ſecond Confinement. Madam <hi>de Longueville</hi> knew that the Cardinal had irreconcileably embroyl'd her with her Husband, and that after thoſe impreſſions of her conduct which the Cardinal had imprinted in her Husbands thoughts, ſhe could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to him in his Government of <hi>Normandy</hi> without the hazard of her Life or Liberty. However the Duke was deſirous to have her company by all manner of ways, nor had ſhe any pretence to avoid this dangerous voyage, but only that ſhe ſtaid to perſwade her Brother to quit the Court in a fury, and prepare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for a Civil War. The Prince of <hi>Conti</hi> aim'd at nothing certain, nevertheleſs he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ow'd his Siſters ſentiments, not knowing what they were, and was deſirous of a War, as being that which would give him an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to quit his Breviary, for which he had no kindneſs. The Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> alſo moſt earneſtly advis'd it; tho his ſentiments proceeded not ſo much from his Ambition as from his jealouſie of Mounſieur the Prince. For he was fallen moſt violently in love with the Dutcheſs of <hi>Chatillon,</hi> who had been a long time before intreagu'd with the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and in regard he could not break off their familiarity but by ſeparating 'em forever, he knew no other way to ſucced but by a War; and that was the only motive
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:53606:210"/> which induc'd him to deſire it. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the Court, and the Prince's behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, ſoon furniſh'd both ſides with occaſion of miſtruſt; and both parties prepar'd a like for a Rupture. The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> ſent the Marquiſs of <hi>Silleri</hi> into <hi>Flanders</hi> under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of diſingaging Madam <hi>de Logueville,</hi> and Marſhal <hi>Turenne</hi> from the Treaties they had made with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to procure his Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but in truth he had orders to take meaſures with the Count of <hi>Fuenſalida</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Low Countries, and to ſound him before hand what aſſiſtance the Prince might expect, if he were conſtrain'd to a War. The Count return'd his anſwer to the propoſal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the uſual cuſtom of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and promiſing much more then could rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably be expected from him, left nothing omitted to engage the Prince to take Arms. The Prince alſo by means of <hi>Vinueil</hi> negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with <hi>Mademoiſelle de Pons</hi> to engage the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> in his party, obliging himſelf when he treated with <hi>Spain</hi> to procure his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, which he did effectually. Moreover upon notice of a intended deſign to arreſt him, he withdrew to St. <hi>Maur,</hi> and by the Duke of <hi>Rochefoucaut</hi> gave notice to the Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leance</hi> of the occaſion of his withdrawing out of the way. He refus'd to ſpeak in private with Marſhal <hi>Gramont,</hi> who came in the King's name to demand the cauſe of his withdrawing, and to invite him to return to <hi>Paris</hi> with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of all ſecurity. But the Prince return'd

But when he arriv'd in the Capital City of the Kingdom, he found that the Cabal of <hi>Slingers</hi> were abſolutely againſt him, in hopes that the Court would protect 'em in their oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him. The Coadjutor, who was the head of 'em, openly declar'd himſelf his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and never went to the Palace without a great number of armed Men at his heels;
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:53606:211"/> which oblig'd the Prince to do the ſame: nay, one day the two parties were ready to have drawn upon one anoher in the great Hall.</p>
                  <p>The Prince therefore fearing leaſt the <hi>Slin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> ſhould be too ſtrong for him at <hi>Paris,</hi> paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed into <hi>Guyenne,</hi> where fortune was as little favourable to him, the Count <hi>de Harcourt</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving always the advantage over him. On the other ſide, the Duke of <hi>Nemours,</hi> who commanded the Army that came out of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi> who led the Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi>'s Troops, being ready to joyn near the River <hi>Loire,</hi> corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponded ſo ill together, that the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> thought it neceſſary to take the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of both together, to prevent the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky conſequences that might attend the miſunderſtandings of the Chieftains. To that purpoſe he at length departed, leaving the Count of <hi>Marſin</hi> in <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> to keep that City with the whole Province under his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and to hinder his enemies from tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any advantage of the differences between the Prince of <hi>Conti,</hi> and Madam <hi>de Longue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville.</hi> For the Prince of <hi>Conti</hi> could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure ſhe ſhould have any Lover, and diſplay'd thoſe tranſports of his jealouſie which no way became a Brother.</p>

To which purpoſe he ſent away <hi>Gourville,</hi> with an Inſtrument drawn up in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Dutcheſs of <hi>Chatillon,</hi> and the Dukes of <hi>Nemours</hi> and <hi>Rochefoucaut.</hi> Preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the greateſt part of the Propoſitions made by the Prince were granted, nor had the Treaty been broken off, but upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of the Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> who deſir d that the Dutchy of <hi>Albret</hi> might be taken from the Prince and ſettl d upon him, in lieu of what had been promis'd him for the loſs of <hi>Sedan.</hi> The Dutcheſs of <hi>Ghatillon,</hi> ſeeing the Negotiation broken off, would needs undertake the accommodation her ſelf, and perſwaded the Prince to give his conſent. For ſhe moſt paſſionately deſir'd Peace, out of a deſign to deſpite Madam <hi>de Longueville,</hi> whoſe intereſt it was to hinder a Pacification, that ſhe might not be oblig'd to return to her Husband. The Emulation which Beauty and Courtſhip frequently cauſes among Ladies had occaſion'd an extraordinary feud between the two Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſes; and they had a long time conceal'd their animoſity; but at length it broke out with a vengence on both ſides. Nor did Madam <hi>de Chatillon</hi> confine her Victory to the obligation ſhe had laid upon <hi>Nemours</hi> to breake of all fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity with Madam <hi>de Longueville</hi> upon cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances no leſs entrenching upon her Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour then publickly known, ſhe would alſo

                  <p>The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>'s Army being repuls'd by the King's, was conſtrain'd to retreat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to St. <hi>Anthonies</hi> Subburbs, where the Marſhal <hi>Turenne</hi> fell upon it, and where a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Valliant Men fell on both ſides, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt the Duke of <hi>Chatillon;</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed all the Princeſs Forces had been defeated had not the <hi>Pariſians</hi> opend St. <hi>Anthonies</hi>-Gate, and ſuffer'd 'em to march through the City. Nevertheleſs, the cares of the War did not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Generals from making Love. For the Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> underſtanding that the Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi> had an Intreague with a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of Quality, whoſe name we know not, endeavour'd to deprive him of that Conqueſt, and his endeavours prov'd ſucceſsful, the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

Up went he into the firſt apartment, and there found the Wife of an Advocate, handſome enough, and nothing at all ſquemiſh, tho' ſhe perceiv'd the miſtake of her Chamber-maid who had introduc'd the Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of another Advocate who was her Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes Gallant. However, whether it were that the Woman's eaſie Condeſcention diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted the Duke, or that his imagination was full of the Perſon that he ſought for, he prov'd ſuch another Perſon as <hi>Petronius</hi> repreſents <hi>Polyenus</hi> to be in Company of <hi>Circe.</hi> He did all that he could to reinliven his languiſhing Vigour, and ſpent ſo much time in reinforc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his waſted Ammunition that he miſt his opportunity of the other meeting. However being deſirous to make his excuſe to the diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Lady, he went to her and engag'd her to meet him the next day in the Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth, belonging to the Phyſick Garden in the Suburbs of St. <hi>Victor.</hi> Now it happen'd that the Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi> going t ither the ſame day and the ſame hour; heard through a thick Hedge, the voice of theſe two Lovers. With that he fell a liſtning, and underſtood enough to convince him, that the Duke of <hi>Nemours,</hi> with whom he was but too much embroyl'd already, had made his Miſtreſs unfaithful to him. Thereupon the Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi> chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leng'd
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:53606:213"/> the Duke of <hi>Nemours,</hi> who accepted the Challenge; and tho Brothers-in-Law, they met in the Horſe-Market. The Duke of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours</hi> diſcharg d his Piſtol firſt with more fury then good aim, and having miſt his Blow, the Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi> diſcharg'd his ſo well to the purpoſe in his adverſaries Head, that he lay d him weltring at his feet. The death of this Duke having deliver'd the Prince from a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, his affection for Madam <hi>de Chatillon</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to grow cold, and being over-rul'd by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> he paſs'd into <hi>Flanders.</hi> On the other ſide the Dutcheſs ſtrove to comfort her ſelf up for the loſs that her diſloyalty had brought upon her with the Abbot <hi>Toquet,</hi> who fell paſſionatly in love with her at the Conferences they had together about the Peace; this Abbot being entruſted by Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Mazarin</hi> with the management of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts.</p>
                  <p>1653. The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> being releas'd from the Caſtle of <hi>Segovia,</hi> in purſuance of the Treaty which the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> had made with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> prov'd not ſo generous as to take his Benefactors ſide, but return'd to <hi>Paris,</hi> more in love with <hi>Mademoiſelle de Pons</hi> then he was before his impriſonment, but he met not, in her, with the ſame ſentiments for himſelf. Her inclinations were altogether for <hi>Malicorne;</hi> and in regard ſhe made it her buſineſs to find out all the ways imaginable to be in his company, without giving the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:53606:214"/> Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> any cauſe of ſuſpicion, ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd the Prince to take his Rival into his ſervice, faigning that ſhe was highly obligd to the Gentlemans Father, and that he had aſſiſted her with an extraordinary affection during the Dukes abſence; and that ſhe might have the more eaſie opportunities to enjoy <hi>Malicorne,</hi> ſhe deſir'd the credulous Prince never to viſit her but in the Evening; alleadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that their intreague had made a great noiſe, and therefore 'twas requiſite they ſhould ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage their familiarity with ſo much the more diſcretion by which means ſhe had her full li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to enjoy her Favourite in the Afternoons. Nor did theſe ſcruples ſerve to any other end then to encreaſe the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi>'s love, who being reſolv'd to accompliſh his Marriage with Madam <hi>de Pons,</hi> without minding his former engagements, propos'd to her the ſpending ſome months in <hi>Guyenne,</hi> there to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe a little Houſe where ſhe might publiſh the Banes of Matrimony with more privacy, while he on the other ſide retir'd into his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Eu,</hi> with the ſame deſign. <hi>Mademoiſelle de Pons</hi> having accepted this propoſal, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for her a magnificent Equipage, and accompani'd her as far as <hi>Eſtampes. Malicorne</hi> having notice which Roade ſhe took, road privately before, and ſtaid for her upon the Bank of the River <hi>Loire,</hi> where ſhe took him into her Coach, and drove away for <hi>Blois.</hi> But croſſing through that City, upon the Bridge they perceiv'd the Duke of <hi>Orleance,</hi>
                     <pb n="195" facs="tcp:53606:214"/> who retir'd thither after the majority of the King. <hi>Mademoiſelle de Pons,</hi> unwilling to be known, kept on her Mask, tho ſhe were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to have pull'd it off, out of reſpect to a Prince of the Blood. The Duke of <hi>Orle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> no leſs ſurpriz'd at her rudeneſs then the magnificence of her Equipage, ſent a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man after her, as far as <hi>Amboiſe,</hi> with orders to enquire the names of the perſons that were in the Coach: which as it was no difficult thing to learn, ſo the Duke was fully inform'd the ſame Evening. Now the Duke had a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Grudge againſt the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and was glad of the opportunity to let the whole Court underſtand that the Duke was the Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to carry on his Miſtreſſes Intreague. To that purpoſe he wrote to all his Friends what he had ſeen, and the news was ſoon ſpread abroad. Thereupon the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi>'s kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred conſulted together, which way to make him ſenſible of his Miſtreſſes infidelity, ſo that he might be fully convinc'd: but no body would undertake this affair, becauſe they fear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d the tranſports of the Dukes fury, and knew it was a difficult thing to infuſe into him the belief of any thing to the prejudice of a perſon, who as he was fully perſwaded, was never guilty of any miſcariage of that nature. However, the Duke of <hi>Cheuvreuſe</hi> was pitch'd upon, as being the moſt proper perſon of any other, to act that part, by reaſon his advanc'd years would incline the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> to liſten to him with ſo much the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:53606:215"/> more patience; and he was willing to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the buſineſs. The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> had much ado at firſt to believe what Aged <hi>Cheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vreuſe</hi> told him, however it fixt ſome kind of jealouſie in his mind. Now <hi>Mademoiſelle de Pons</hi> who was oblig'd to part with <hi>Malicorne</hi> upon her entrance into <hi>Guyenne,</hi> not being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to live abſent from him, wrote to the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and deſir'd he would be pleas'd that ſhe might return to <hi>Paris.</hi> The Duke, well underſtanding the cauſe of her impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, deſir'd her on the other ſide to ſtay for ſome time longer with her Parents; but ſhe, without any reſpect to his requeſt, ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and away ſhe came. When ſhe was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'e, the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> brib'd one of her Chambermaids, and by her means got into his hands the little Box wherein ſhe lockt up all her Lovers <hi>Billet douxes,</hi> and there he found a great number of Letters, which plainly made out a form'd Intreague; beſides ſome other Letters from the Marſhal <hi>de Aumont,</hi> and Marſhal <hi>d' Albert,</hi> that ſpoke the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of fortunate Lovers; which drove him to his wits end.</p>
                  <p>Upon this, he broke off with <hi>Mademoiſelle de Pons,</hi> and us d her very unworthily: for he ſu'd her at Common-Law, for a pair of Pendants valu'd at 50000 Crowns, and a rich ſuit of Tapeſtry which he had given her, but with very ill ſucceſs. So that the loſs of his Suite redoubld his indignation, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to aſſault her in her own houſe; of
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:53606:215"/> which ſhe having notice, ſent for the Marſhal <hi>d'Aumont,</hi> and Marſhal <hi>d' Albert</hi> to protect her; the one being Captain of the Guards, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lieutenant of the King's Light Horſe. Preſently they haſtn'd to her aid with a Body of Cavalry, which was the reaſon that the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> made no farther attempt. Fain would Marſhal <hi>d' Albert</hi> have made his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket of this piece of ſervice, and exacted com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliances from <hi>Mademoiſelle de Pons,</hi> which ſhe could not find in her heart to grant, becauſe ſhe doated altogether upon <hi>Malicorne.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon that jealous Lover reſolv'd to be reveng'd upon her for her ingratitude, and entring to that purpoſe, into a League with the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> they reſolv'd to get an Order from the King to take her away by force, and ſend her into an Abby in the <hi>Pyreneans,</hi> of which a Kinſwoman of the Marſhals was Abbeſs. Madam <hi>de Pons,</hi> having notice of this Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, ſtole out of <hi>Paris</hi> in the habit of a Country market-woman, with only two of her waiting women, and went to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of purſuing her Steward who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving robb'd her was fled the ſame way. At her departure, ſhe left the fatal Box, wherein were all her Love Letters, with <hi>Mademoiſelle de Tieure,</hi> who had been a Penſioner with her at <hi>Chaſſemidi,</hi> with orders to deliver it to no perſon living but her ſelf, which was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the cauſe of her breaking off with <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licorne,</hi> as we ſhall relate in due place. As for the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> he, being inform'd
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:53606:216"/> of her departure, reſolv'd to make a ſecond voyage to <hi>Naples,</hi> and to that purpoſe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark'd himſelf aboard the King's Fleet.</p>
                  <p>1654. Nor was the Duke the only Perſon that prov'd unfortunate in his Amours: for the Abbot <hi>Touquet,</hi> who was no leſs violently in love with the Dutcheſs of <hi>Chatillon,</hi> left nothing omitted to gain her affection, but all the complacency ſhe had for him was only in order to coaxe him out of conſiderable preſents. One day that he went to viſit her, he found her upon the Bed in a ſullen moody humour, nor could all that he could ſay to her put her out of it. Thereupon he ask'd her chief woman what he ſhould do to divert her, and propounded ſeveral ways that were not accepted. But at length the cunning Ouiſtrel, who was acquainted with all her Miſtreſſes knacks, put it into the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots head to carry her to St. <hi>Germons</hi> Fair, and the Maid and the Miſtreſs acted their parts ſo well together, that they got out of the incontinent Abbot a Service of Gilt Plate, valu'd at above Fifty Thouſand Crowns. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhe had other Admirers, that came off at a cheaper rate; among the reſt <hi>Bouchu,</hi> Intendant in <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and <hi>Cambiac,</hi> Canon in the Cathedral of <hi>Albi,</hi> who was above fifty years of Age.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Mademoiſelle de Pons,</hi> ſhe made as great a Hurlyburly at the Court of <hi>Bruſſelles,</hi> as ſhe had done in <hi>France.</hi> The Marquiſs of
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:53606:216"/> 
                     <hi>Bouteville,</hi> a Favourite of the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>'s, and the Marquiſs of <hi>Fuenclara,</hi> a Captain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Don John of Auſtria,</hi> both offer'd her their Services, and to the firſt ſhe lent a favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ear. The Prince himſelf alſo, paid her ſome ſedulities, but finding more reſiſtance then he expected, he quitted her Lodgings full of Choller and Indignation. Some days after, he underſtood that <hi>Bouteville</hi> had not been ſo unkindly repuls'd; which put him into ſuch a Chafe, that he ſwore to him, he would never pardon him, if he did not quit her forever, offering on his part never to have any more to do with her. Moreover to let him ſee that he would be exact to his word, he obtain'd an order from <hi>Don John,</hi> by which Madam <hi>de Pons</hi> was commanded to leave <hi>Bruſſells</hi> in twenty four hours, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in eight days to depart the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Territories. Howerver <hi>Bouteville</hi> paid her ſeveral private viſits, after ſhe had receiv'd this Order, and they agreed together, that ſhe ſhould make a ſhew of departing, and that after ſhe had travell'd about four Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues from <hi>Bruſſells,</hi> ſhe ſhould return in the night time, to a Chamber which he would hire for her in a by corner of the Town. Nor was ſhe worſe then her word to <hi>Boute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi> and for fifteen days together they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d each other in great tranquility. But by misfortune, <hi>Fuenclara</hi> having eſpi'd one of Madam <hi>de Depons's</hi> Chamber-maids looking out at the Window, he learnt by her that
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:53606:217"/> her Miſtreſs lay in that Lodging <hi>Incognito:</hi> for it was not the firſt time that that ſame damſel had taſted of his liberality. <hi>Mademoiſelle de Pons,</hi> finding her ſelf diſcover'd, would ſtay no longer at <hi>Bruſſells,</hi> for fear of being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted, but withdrew to the <hi>Hague;</hi> where ſhe ſtay'd all the while that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> kept the field.</p>
                  <p>But after they had taken up their Winter Quarters, <hi>Bouteville</hi> ſent for his Miſtreſs to <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp,</hi> whither ſhe was coming; but he ſent her word by one of the Trumpeters of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to miſs <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and return to <hi>Bruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells,</hi> in regard the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> was gone to give inſtructions about ſome thing to be done in the former City. Madam <hi>de Pons,</hi> no ſooner receiv'd theſe tydings, but ſhe ſet forward, and by an unlucky miſchance, met the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> in a narrow hollow way, in his return form viſiting the Frontier Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who thought he knew her, but <hi>Lainett</hi> and the Preſident <hi>Viole</hi> perſwaded him to the contrary. After this happy eſcape, Madam <hi>de Pons</hi> arriv'd at <hi>Bruſſells,</hi> and alighted at the Appartment which <hi>Bouteville</hi> had hird and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd for her. Their firſt enterview was very tender and paſſionate, and at night they parted very well ſatisfi'd the one with the other. But when ſhe was a bed, ſhe was aſtoniſh'd to hear the door open, and an unknown perſon come into her Chamber: She ask'd him what he would have; but he went out again, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out anſwering ſo much as one word: preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:53606:217"/> ſhe call'd her Maids, but they could give her no account of this adventure. But the next morning ſhe was inform'd that the Chamber where ſhe lodg'd, had been hird by an Italian Fencing Maſter, who had a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty woman to his Wife of whom he was jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: that being to ride a little way out of Town, he had carri'd the Key along with him, thinking to ſurprize his Wife at his return, and diſcover whither ſhe had not ſome peculiar favourite beſides himſelf. Thereupon, not knowing that his Wife was remov'd, he open'd the Door ſoftly with his Key but was in ſo great amaze to ſee the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſo richly furniſh'd, and to hear a ſtrange voice ſpeak to him, that he made all the haſt he could out again. Madam <hi>de Pons</hi> told <hi>Bouteville</hi> the Story, who came in a ſhort time after, and the Fencing Maſters jealouſie prov'd the ſubject of their merriment for ſeveral days together.</p>
                  <p>At the beginning of <hi>Autumn</hi> Madam <hi>de Pons</hi> went to the <hi>Spa,</hi> where ſhe ſaw the <hi>Rhine-Grave,</hi> and gain'd a new Conqueſt. He carri'd her home to his Palace, after ſhe had been drinking the Waters; and there ſhe contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted a moſt intimate friendſhip with her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers Wife, who was no leſs innocent then beautiful; and reported up and down that ſhe was highly oblig'd to <hi>Mademoiſelle de Pons,</hi> who had infus'd good humours into her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band: but there were ſome that were careful to diſabuſe her; ſo that Madam <hi>de Pons</hi> dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

At his departure, ſhe gave him a Letter directed to <hi>Mademoiſelle Le Fevre,</hi> which he made uſe of, by adding ſome lines in a counterfieited hand to get out of her hands the little Box wherein were all the Letters from all the Lovers of his unfaithful Miſtreſs, by which he underſtood her complacency for the Marſhalls <hi>d' Aumont</hi> and <hi>d' Albret,</hi> during their Intreagues, and deeming her unworthy of a real Paſſion, he reſolv'd to forſake her, utterly broke off with her and never ſaw her more.</p>

                  <p>As for the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> he Intreagu'd himſelf with <hi>Mademoiſelle de Gorce,</hi> who was not of ſo illuſtrous a Family but who lov'd him more cordially and faithfully; ſo that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death, ſhe retir'd into the Convent of <hi>Carmelites</hi> where at length ſhe took the Habit upon her.</p>
                  <p>1656. The ſame Year the Queen of <hi>Sweden</hi> arriv'd in <hi>France,</hi> the King ſending the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> to meet and receive her upon the Frontiers. Love had oblig'd that Princeſs to quit her Crown: for ſhe was in Love with Count <hi>Magnus de la Gardia;</hi> and becauſe he refus d to Raign with her, nor could find in his heart to love her, becauſe he had devot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all his Inclinations to the Siſter of <hi>Charles,</hi> Prince <hi>Palatine,</hi> the Father of the preſent King, after ſhe had made uſe of all her addreſs to procure the conſent of the States of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſhe reſign'd her Scepter and the Throne of <hi>Sweden</hi> to the Prince <hi>Palatine</hi> upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he ſhould marry his Siſter to the Count <hi>du la Gardia.</hi> This Queen was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly learned in all the Sciences, ſpoke the greateſt part of the Languages of Europe, and with as much eaſe as ſhe did the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Tongue. Now in regard ſhe had a great Reputation among all the <hi>European</hi> Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſhe ſtrove to conceal the real Motive of her Abdication, and would have People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Religion was the pretence. She had been bred up in the <hi>Lutheran,</hi> and was deſirous
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:53606:219"/> to embrace the <hi>Roman-Catholick</hi>-Faith. To which purpoſe ſhe came into <hi>France,</hi> and took into her Service none but Foreign Officers and <hi>Roman-Catholicks.</hi> Among the reſt, ſhe made the Marquiſs <hi>de Monaldeſchi,</hi> deſcended from a very mean Family in <hi>Italy,</hi> her Squire, and did him the Honour wholly to confide in him</p>
                  <p>After ſhe had ſpent the remainder of the Year at <hi>Paris,</hi> ſhe remov'd to <hi>Fontain Bleau,</hi> at the beginning of the next; where ſhe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd that <hi>Monaldeſchi,</hi> from whom ſhe had had complacencies a little too familiar for a Princeſs to have with one of her Officers, had boaſted of 'em to the diſadvantage of her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. She had alſo intercepted Letters which he wrote to his Friends in <hi>Italy;</hi> for which ſhe firſt upbraided him with his Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude; but ſeeing that he obſtinately per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſever'd in denying his Crime, ſhe convicted him by the Teſtimony of witneſſes that were not to be contradicted, and then deliver'd him to three of her Officers who killd him in the <hi>Stag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Before I finiſh theſe Memoirs, I think my ſelf oblig'd to give ſome account in this place of an Intreague wherein Love had a geeat ſhare: which tho' it began before the Year 1657, and held on for a good while after, I thought it the beſt way to put it altogether. The two Perſons that were moſt entruſted by Cardinal <hi>Mazarin,</hi> and who were employ d in his moſt ſecret Negotiations, were <hi>Gourville,</hi> who had been in the Service of the Duke of <hi>Rochefou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caut,</hi> as we have already ſaid, and <hi>Langlade,</hi> whom he had made Secretary of his Cabinet. Theſe two Men for ſome time were jealous one of another, and did all they could to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice each other: but underſtanding that
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:53606:220"/> neither of 'em was able to prejudice his Companion, they thought it convenient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unite, and act by concert. To which purpoſe they covenanted together equally to ſhare all the profits of their Employments at Court.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Langlade</hi> had been a long time in Love with Madam <hi>de St. Loup,</hi> the Widow of a Collonel of Horſe, who had been in good requeſt at Court. She had ſet her firſt Affections upon the Duke of <hi>Candale,</hi> whom ſhe improv'd to that Politeneſs which afterwards he ſhew'd in Company: for he had but a very ill favour'd Air when he firſt appear'd at Court; but ſhe took care to faſhion him. Theſe two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd Enemies thought it convenient to make uſe of her in the diſcovery of ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as it concern'd 'em to know: they gave her Money to play with the Queen Mother, and engag'd her to give 'em a faithful Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what ſhe heard that Princeſs ſay in reference to their Buſineſs. Now tho theſe two Men acted with ſincerity enough after their Reconciliation, <hi>Langlade</hi> ſoon perceiv'd that <hi>Gourvilles</hi> fortune advanc'd ſwifter then his; which made him covet a more ſtrict Union with him. He had a Siſter, handſome enough, which he propos'd to <hi>Gourville</hi> for a Wife; and <hi>Gourville</hi> would have gladly accepted his Offer, had his Heart been at Liberty; but he had been privately along time in love with Madam <hi>de Parville,</hi> who had all the Qualities proper to engage the moſt ſcrupulous Lover,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:53606:220"/> ſo that he could not find in his Heart to quit her. On the other ſide it was his Intereſt by no means to diſguſt <hi>Langlade.</hi> So that he ſought for ſome plauſible pretence to avoid the Marriage which wſs propos'd to him. The moſt aſſured and the moſt agreeable to his Intentions was privately to marry Madam <hi>de Parville,</hi> and he ſtrove to gain her conſent. But tho' ſhe really lov'd him, ſhe could not bring herſelf to that ſubmiſſion, out of a Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtick Humour common to Perſons of her Sex. Nevertheleſs, as ſhe was willing to help him out of the Labirinth he was in, ſhe gave him leave to tell <hi>Langlade,</hi> they were marry d, and to make good this lye, ſhe took a Journey into the Country, pretending ſhe went to lye in; never minding the Prejudice ſhe might do her Reputation. <hi>Langlade</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd by his Artifice, never thought any more of the Marriage of <hi>Gourville</hi> to his Siſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and ſome after he alſo broke off with Madam <hi>de Loup,</hi> whom he found guilty of much Infidelity. Before he came to Court, he had fallen in Love with a Damſel of Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in his Country, call'd <hi>Mademoiſelle de Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagnol,</hi> and tho' he durſt not propoſe Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to her, yet he exacted from her a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe never to marry any but himſelf; aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her that he would ſend her word, ſo ſoon as he ſhould have rais'd his Fortune to that degree as to make her happy. <hi>Langlade</hi> entruſted <hi>Gour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi> with the aſſurance which he had given the Damſel, and declar'd with ſomething of
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:53606:221"/> Sorrow and Vexation mixt together, that he thought himſelf not rich enough to pretend to that Allyance, as not being worth in all above forty thouſand Crowns. <hi>Gourville</hi> bid him not be troubled for that, and to encourage him to go and accompliſh his marriage, promis'd to give him as much more. Upon that aſſurance away went <hi>Langlade,</hi> and marri'd Madam <hi>de Campagnol,</hi> who was overjoy'd to ſee him ſo faithful to his promiſe. After the Nuptial ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities were over, <hi>Langlade</hi> returns with his new Wife to <hi>Paris,</hi> where he found that <hi>Gourville</hi> had hir'd 'em a handſome houſe, and richly furniſh'd it: The moveables he gave to <hi>Langlade,</hi> and a conſiderable quantity of Plate and Jewels to his Wife, beſides the Forty thouſand Crowns; and Madam <hi>de Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi> took great care to bring the young <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanſſal</hi> into good company. Thus ſettl'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, theſe two fortunate lovers liv'd a long time contented one with the other: but poor <hi>Gourville</hi> loſt his Miſtreſs by ſickneſs in the full vigour of his amorous heat. That Lady had been ſo happy as to be violently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd by ſeveral, more eſpecially by <hi>

                  <p>Toward the end of the year 1659, the Court remov'd to <hi>Lyon,</hi> under pretence of a marriage in Negotiation between the King and the Princeſs <hi>Margaret</hi> of <hi>Savoy.</hi> The Duke repair'd thither with all his Court, and great were the rejoycings for a month, but the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> having diſcover'd that while they were amuſing him with hopes of that Puiſſant Alliance, <hi>Pimantel</hi> had concluded the King's marriage with the Infanta of <hi>Spain,</hi> he took poſt and return'd to <hi>Chamberi,</hi> where he ſolac'd himſelf in the Arms of <hi>Mademoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle de Terceſſon</hi> for the affront which he had receiv'd. But tho he had heap'd his Favours upon her, ſhe was ne're the more Loyal to him for that: for the Marquiſs of <hi>Fleuri</hi> had corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the fruit of her firſt affections, and ſhe gave him frequent meetings; which the Duke
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:53606:222"/> ſuſpecting, commanded one of his Lacqueys to attend her, with orders never to quit her. But the Marquiſs to rid himſelf of that ſame Spy, caus'd him to be thrown into the <hi>Po;</hi> which confirm'd the Dukes ſuſpitions, ſo that he caus'd the Marquiſs of <hi>Fleuri</hi> to be arreſted, and arraign'd for the death of the Lacquey; but all that he pai'd for his folly was a long impriſonment. After which, the Duke being reconcil'd to <hi>Mademoiſelle de Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſon,</hi> marri'd her to the Marquiſs of <hi>Cohourre,</hi> who enjoy d one of the principal Offices in his Houſehold; but ſhe ſhew'd him ſo many ſcurvy tricks, that he was forc'd to ſend her into <hi>France,</hi> where ſhe met with ſeveral ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures that deſerve a particular Hiſtory. The King's Marriage with the Infanta was ſolemiz'd in the year 1660, and Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi> dy'd at the beginning of the year 1661.</p>

                  <head>Intreagues of the Court of <hi>France</hi> under the Raign of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV, from the death of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Mazarin,</hi> to this preſent time.</head>
                  <p>IF the King's affection were no more then his paſtime before his marriage, 'twas not afterwards the ſame. He felt a real paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and that paſſion took poſſeſſion of him after an extraordinary manner. <hi>Madamoiſelle de la Valiere,</hi> who was one of <hi>Madam</hi>'s Maids of Honour, perceiv'd the Monarchs humour ſo agreeable to hers, that ſhe fell deſperately in love with him. She imparted the ſecret of her inclination to one of her intimate friends, and this friend not heing able long to keep the ſecret with which ſhe was intruſted, there were ſo many perſons at Court who were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it, that they made a ſport of it to the King.</p>
                  <p>Now, in regard there is nothing more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural then for a man to know the perſons that love and admire him, beſides that the King was naturally amorous, 'twas not long before he admitted himſelf into <hi>la Valieres</hi> company. The firſt ſight of her wrought no great ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:53606:223"/> for that there was nothing extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in her aſpect, beſides that ſhe limpt a little: in a word ſhe had nothing of handſome ſhape. However it cannot be deny'd, but that from the very moment that he ſaw her, he had ſomething of an inclination for her, yet ſo limited as only to think of well beſtowing her upon ſome Lord of the Court; but he could not reſiſt his Stars. Three days after he went to viſit Madam, who was ſomewhat indiſpos'd; but there ſtopping with <hi>la Valiere,</hi> he was ſo charm'd with her wit, that he could no longer curb the violent paſſion that forc'd him to fall in love with her. He ſtay'd but a little while with Madam; but he return'd the next day; and continu'd his viſits for a month together, which made moſt people believe that he was fallen in love with Madam; and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, to ſay truth, flatter'd herſelf, as if the Conqueſt had been hers.</p>
                  <p>Theſe viſits plainly ſhew'd that the King was paſſionately in love, nevertheleſs, in regard he durſt not diſcover his Paſſion, and for that it was contrary to the rules of decency, to be every day at Madams Apartment and never ſee her, he found a way to give it out all over the Court, that he was in love with her. He talk'd of her continually: he extold her Air and her Beauty to the Skies, and ſpoke it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly, that ſince <hi>Mancini</hi>'s departure, he had never ſpent a happy minute but in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Madam. Nevertheleſs, 'tis certain that all the Proofs he gave of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:53606:223"/> in love with that Princeſs were only his being continually with her, and his always whiſpering her in the ear before company, when at the ſame time he talk'd to her only of things indifferent, or of <hi>la Valiere,</hi> after which he fell into moſt dreadful dumps. Nor did Madam know what to think, not dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the King could ever love a Damſel ſo far from beautiful, that ſhe was the daily ſubject of the Duke of <hi>Roquelaure</hi>'s jokes and Lampoons.</p>
                  <p>But as paſſionately in love as the King was, he was a long time before he durſt make known his affection, nor did he do it but after an indirect manner. One day that he was walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Park of <hi>Verſailles,</hi> he bemoan'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf after a manner moſt extreamly tender, that he had not found himſelf well for ſome time. <hi>La Valiere,</hi> who was preſent, ſhew'd her ſelf to be very much afflicted at it, and gave marks of an extraordinary tenderneſs. The King, who perceiv'd it, took her aſide: He told her, that ſhe was extremely obliging to be concern'd for his health; and at the ſame time declar'd to her that ſhe was the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Miſtreſs of his Life, his Death and his Repoſe. <hi>La Valiere</hi> was at a ſtand, and for a while profoundly ſilent. The King upbraided her with inſenſiblity. But then, ſhe made him an anſwer that altogether charm'd him. Their converſation laſted three hours, and was only interrupted by a ſhowre of Rain. All the reſt of the day, <hi>la Valiere</hi> mov'd with a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive air, and the King appear'd to be no leſs
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:53606:224"/> reſtleſs in his thoughts. The next day they met again, and their diſcourſe was ſtill of the ſame nature. The ſame day the King ſent her ſome Jewels of very great value, together with the following Billet.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>D' ye deſire my death? tell me ſincerely, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam. It behoves me to ſatisfie your longing. All the World moſt earneſtly ſeeks my diſturbance. 'Tis given out, that Madam is not cruel, and that fortune wiſhes me well; but all this while they neither ſay, that I love ye, nor that you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce me to diſpair. You bear me a kind of tender affection that overwhelmes me. For the love of God, change your manner of dealing with a Prince that dies for your ſake. Either be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Compaſſionate, or altogether Cruel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King was not ſatisfi'd with this Billet wherein he had diſplai d all his tenderneſs, but the next day in the moſt magnificent ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel that ever he put on in his life, he went to viſit her at Madams Apartment; at what time the Maids of Honour that were with <hi>la Valiere,</hi> withdrew, out of reſpect. On the other ſide, the King reſolving to know his deſtiny, and to puſh on his good fortune, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſted her in a kind of trembling poſture. In concluſion, he told her all that a tender and violent love could infuſe into a perſon of wit inſpir'd by an amorous paſſion. But then <hi>Mademoiſelle de la Valiere,</hi> who was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in love with him, could no longer hold out againſt ſo ſtrong a Battery, ſo that the King return'd happy. He went to viſit her
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:53606:224"/> the next day; this familiarity laſted for fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen days. But an accident having diſcover'd the Intreague, the two Lovers no longer diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled; which extreamly perplext Madam, who really imagin'd that the King had had a kindneſs for her.</p>
                  <p>Her vexation therefore to ſee that the King had prefer d on of her Maids before her, caus'd her to ſpeak of it to both the Queens: however ſhe forbore to ſignifie any thing of her reſentment. The Queen Mother, who was well acquainted with the King's humour in this particular, was terribly alarm'd, and reſolv'd forthwith to ſpeak of it to <hi>la Valiere;</hi> which ſhe did with ſo much embitterment, that two days after, ſhe put her ſelf into a Convent.</p>
                  <p>The King, who knew nothing of this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, was extremely ſurpriz'd, when he heard of it. He preſently got a Horſeback and commanded a Coach to follow him. So ſoon as he came to the Houſe where ſhe was inclos'd, he demanded to ſee her. She ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear d at the Grate, whereafter he had made her a thouſand tender Vows and Proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he bid her immediately come forth. She excus'd her ſelf at firſt, alledging the ill uſage of both the Queens. To which the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd that he was King, and that he would fain ſee who they were that durſt controule his Actions. At length therefore ſhe came forth, and put her ſelf into the King s Coach. Upon the Roade the King propos d to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:53606:225"/> a Houſe and a Train for her. But that ſeeming too glorious, ſhe avoided it for that time by only returning him ſubmiſſive thanks. Thereupon the King carry'd her himſelf to Madam, and recommended her to her care, which redoubl'd the Princeſſes Deſpite. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that the King continu'd his Viſits with more aſſiduity then before. He openly ſent her Preſents the moſt magnificent that Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty could purchaſe. All this while, the King continually urging her to take a Houſe, ſhe at laſt conſented, and he gave her <hi>Biron</hi>-Houſe, which he went himſelf to ſee furniſh'd with the Richeſt movables that were in <hi>France.</hi> The Queen was almoſt at Deaths Door for Grief; but her Amends lay in her own hands; what could not be avoyded was to be endur'd. At the ſame time alſo the King fell ſick at <hi>Verſailles. La Valiere</hi> was more prudent then to viſit him. However, his Indiſpoſition not proving dangerous, at the ſame inſtant that Liberty was allow'd for Perſons of Quality to pay him their Devoirs, ſhe wrote to him the following Lines.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>'Tis the General Report, that You are very ill. It may be, 'tis only to afflict me. 'Tis likewiſe ſaid, that You are diſturb'd at this laſt Rumour. In the midſt of theſe Perplexities, I begg the Life of my Lover, and then, am ready to abandon the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and all the World beſides, Wherefore, if You love me, will you not permit me to pay You the Duty of a Viſit? Adieu; ſend for me to morrow; that is to ſay, if my Diſquiet will ſuffer me to live till then.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:53606:225"/>
                  <p>The King kiſs'd the Billet a thouſand times and order'd Madam <hi>de St., Agnan</hi> to bring <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demoiſelle la Valiere</hi> to him. His Orders were obey'd: he ſaw her with a thouſand Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of joy; and exceeded ſo far in his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous Careſſes with his Miſtreſs, that he fell into a Relaps. But that Exceſs of his produc'd no bad effect, in regard that <hi>la Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liere,</hi> nine Months after, was brought to Bed of a Young Princeſs that prov'd a moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanting Beauty.</p>
                  <p>The King's Love was ſo violent, that ſome time after he became jealous of his Miſtreſs. He went to Viſit her every day, but he only mus'd, or fell a reading all the while he was there, and ſometimes left her without ſo much as hardly ſpeaking to her. His jealouſie became ſo prevelent, that he fell into a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful fit of Melancholy. However in regard that jealouſie moſt commonly proceeds from an exceſs of Paſſion, he was taken, one Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with ſo violnet a Pain in his Head, and ſuch frequent Vomitings, that the Duke of St. <hi>Agnan,</hi> to whom the King had imparted his jealouſie, thought it convenient to give <hi>la Valiere</hi> notice of it. He alſo put her in mind, that it became her to leave nothing omitted that might contribute to his Cure. <hi>La Valiere</hi> made anſwer, that the Kings Humour had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely afflicted her, but that ſhe could not condeſend to begg Pardon for that ſhe was never Guilty of: that in a word, ſhe had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to complain of the King, but that His
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:53606:226"/> Majeſty had no reaſon to blame her. The Kings Indiſpoſition redoubl d: but as violent as his Headake was, his Love was yet far more impetuous. He bid the Duke of St. <hi>Agnan</hi> go immediately to his Miſtreſs, and acquaint her with his Malady; who preſently return'd with the following Billet.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Did I but know the cauſe of your Pains, I would apply a Remedy, tho' it coſt me my Life. But Good God! how much in vain it is to tell you what I ſay. 'Tis not I that can diſpoſe of Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties happy or unlucky Dayes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King was charm'd with the manner of his Miſtreſſes writing, who preſently after came to ſee him, together with <hi>Madam de Montauzier,</hi> who retir'd, out of reſpect, to the end of the Room with the Duke of St. <hi>Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan,</hi> while <hi>la Valiere</hi> ſate upon the King's Bed. Where ſhe carreſs'd him with a thouſand ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der expreſſions, which ſo enchanted the King, that he beg'd her Pardon a thouſand times. This their Converſation laſted five hours, and then they parted after they had reciprocally vow'd to Love each other Eternally.</p>
                  <p>The two Queens were at their witts end, to ſee the King's exceſſive Devotion to <hi>la Valiere,</hi> nor was their any thing which they left omitted to take him off from this extream Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. But when they found that all their Efforts prov d fruitleſs, they thought there was no other way but for Father <hi>Anat,</hi> who was his Confeſſor, to interpoſe his Spiritual Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Which he did, and that too, after ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:53606:226"/> a manner, that the King thank'd him for his good Counſel and his Service; but told him withal, that for the future he would have no other Confeſſor but his Curate. Thus was Poor Father <hi>Anat</hi> turn'd out of favour, to the great grief of his Brethren, whom he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got to conſult upon this tickliſh point.</p>
                  <p>Sometime after it came into the Kings head, that he would have both the Queens receive <hi>la Valiere</hi> into their favour. To which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he ſpoke of it to Madam <hi>de Montauzier,</hi> who went at the ſame Inſtant by his Order, to the Young Queen's Chamber. Madam <hi>de Montauzier</hi> was very much perplexed about the complaint ſhe had to deliver: however ſhe ventur'd upon her meſſage; but the Queen would by no means liſten to her. Three days after ſhe miſcarry'd; which had like to have coſt her her life. The King appear'd to be very much afflicted at it; and one day as he ſtood by the Queens Bed ſide, ſhe deſir'd him, in the preſence of the Queen Mother and a Clergyman of Note, to beſtow <hi>la Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liere</hi> in Marriage. To which the King made anſwer, that if <hi>la Valiere</hi> were ſo diſpos'd, he would not be againſt it, and preſently bethought himſelf of the Marquiſs of <hi>Vardes</hi> for her Husband. But the Marqueſs who was in love with Madam <hi>de Soiſſons,</hi> and had no mind to any of the Kings Miſtreſſes, laught at the Propoſal. And afterwards the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſs of <hi>Vardes</hi> and Count <hi>de Guiche,</hi> made ſuch bold Lampoons upon the King's Amours, that they were both baniſht the Court.</p>
                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:53606:227"/>
                  <p>The King, who had a vehement affection for <hi>la Valiere,</hi> and underſtood how terribly ſhe was diſcompos'd upon the Propoſal of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, went to ſee her three times a day. <hi>La Valiere</hi> however could not forbear upbraiding the King with the little love he had for her, ſince he could conſent ſo eaſily to reſign her into the Embraces of another. But the King gave her ſuch potent Reaſons for what he did, that his Miſtriſs was ſatisfied.</p>
                  <p>The Kings Aſſiduitie and Affection for <hi>la Valiere</hi> thus redoubling, they who approv'd not his Familiarity would needs proceed to violence. One night certain Perſons in Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards got into her Chamber by the help of Ladders made of Cords. But ſhe avoided the danger, I know not how, and the King ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed her Guards, and a Steward to taſt all the Meat that was carryed to her Table. People diſcours'd according to their Fancies upon this Adventure; but 'tis an eaſie thing to underſtand from whence the Blow came, without being a Conjurer.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, <hi>la Valieres</hi> Enemies were not at all diſcourag'd: there was nothing which they did not attempt to deprive her of the Kings Affection, The Duke of <hi>Mazarin,</hi> who pretended to a world of devotion, demanded of him a Particular and private Audience, which was granted him. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he Subject of their whole diſcourſe was upon a Viſion which the Duke had ſeen that the Kingdom ſhould be quite ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in'd, if the King did not utterly abandon <hi>la
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:53606:227"/> Valiere</hi>'s Company: withal he told his Majeſty at length that he had a Commiſſion from God himſelf to give him that fair warning. And I, reply'd the King, adviſe ye from my ſelf, to take a great care of your Brains, which are in a deplorable condition, and to reſtore like a Good Chriſtian what your Uncle the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal has robb'd from the Kingdom. Upon which the Duke made him a low Bow, and withdrew full of ſhame and confuſion.</p>
                  <p>Two or three Months after, the Queen would needs make her laſt Efforts. She talk'd to him her ſelf of the ſcandal which he brought upon his Kingdom by a familiarity that was the ſport of all the Courts of Chriſtendom. To which the King reply'd, that Kings and Queens had always been the talk of the world, and that ſhe knew by experience that ſhe her ſelf had not been ſpar'd. Which ſo netled the Queen to hear him touch upon that ſtring, that ſhe never after open'd her Lips to reprove him for his Amours. The next day <hi>la Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liere</hi> was brought to bed of a Prince. The King who was almoſt all alone with her when her Pains came upon her, was at a loſs; and it may be ſaid, that he was half her Midwife. Soon after he made her a Dutcheſs; and ſtill the King continued his Viſits to her; and one day he found her in a deep Melancholly. For as for her Beauty it was never very charming; ſo ſhe was grown ſo lean after her laſt lying in, that it was a great mortification to her. Now in regard ſhe perceiv'd that the King
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:53606:228"/> was ſenſible of her Penſiveneſs, ſhe confeſt to him, that ſhe was afraid he had not the ſame Affection for her which formerly he had. For, added ſhe, do you think that my Looking Glaſſes does not inform me that I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt loſt thoſe allurements that render Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes agreeable to their Lovers. Yet this I dare ſay, that you will never meet with other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, what you have found in me. I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand ye, reply'd the King; But wherefore do you thus by your unjuſt ſuſpicions affront a Prince that adores and ever will adore ye as long as he lives?</p>
                  <p>This Proteſtation charm'd <hi>la Valiere.</hi> Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, 'tis certain that the King began to miſs thoſe charms which he had found in her till then; tho' he was convinced that he lov'd her, when he conſulted his own thoughts. In a word, he was never taken with her Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but with her Wit and her Behaviour, and ſomthing I know not what, which it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for a Man to expreſs.</p>
                  <p>About this time it was that Madam <hi>de Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſpan</hi> appear'd at Court. And in regard ſhe was a Perſon of a Tranſcending Beauty, ſhe laid great deſigns to inſnare the Kings heart. But as yet <hi>la Valiere</hi> poſſeſs'd it ſo intirely, that all her Plots prov'd ineffectual. So that finding the King ſo little inclin'd to entertain her, ſhe caſt her eyes upon <hi>Monſieur,</hi> and he comply'd, however he had another Miſtreſs who diſguſted Madam <hi>de Monteſpan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:53606:228"/>
                  <p>It may be ſaid, that the King had ſtill ſome little inclination for <hi>la Valiere.</hi> But for all that, at the ſame time that Madam <hi>de Monteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan</hi> diſplay'd all her temptations at Court to render him ſenſible of her Charms, he had ſome little kindneſs for the Princeſs of <hi>Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co.</hi> That new Miſtreſs was nothing cruel. However the King grew weary of her in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little time.</p>
                  <p>M. <hi>de Lauſun,</hi> who at firſt had no ſmall ſhare in the Princeſs of <hi>Monaco,</hi> was ſo enrag'd at the Infidelity of his Miſtreſs, that he payd all his vows to Madam <hi>de Monteſpan.</hi> Nor was he long before he obtain'd her laſt favours. Thus M. <hi>de Lauſun</hi>'s Happineſs became the publick diſcourſe of the Court, and the King reflecting upon the good fortune of his Fovourite, of whom all people gave out, that he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd by the moſt beautiful Woman of <hi>France,</hi> this made him look upon Madam <hi>de Monteſpan,</hi> as a Perſon that had all thoſe perfections which really ſhe had. And from that time forward it was, that he began to fall off from his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to <hi>la Valiere;</hi> for ſhe was ſtill call'd by that name tho' ſhe had the Title of Dutcheſs conferr'd upon her. Madam <hi>de Monteſpan,</hi> on the otherſide, had too watchful an eye, not to perceive as ſoon that the King began to have a growing kindneſs for her, and from that very time ſhe endeavour d to the utmoſt of her pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to ſettle her ſelf at Court. This ſhe thought ſhe might be able to do, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> once ſhe could but wind her ſelf into a ſtrict amity with Madam
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:53606:229"/> 
                     <hi>de la Valiere.</hi> Nor did ſhe attempt it in vain, while Madam <hi>de la Valiere</hi> ſought on her ſide to disburthen into the boſome of ſome ſincere friend her ſorrow for the extinguiſhing flames of her Lover. And the forwardneſs of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Monteſpan</hi> ſo highly pleas'd <hi>la Valiere,</hi> that they became great friends, in outward appearance, eſpecially on Madam <hi>de Monteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan</hi>'s part, who had her aim, and hated at the bottom of her heart a Rivaleſs whoſe favour with the King ſhe was labouring might and main to undermine. On the otherſide, the King who began already to feel ſomething of tenderneſs for Madam <hi>de Monteſpan,</hi> was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyd to find her everyday with <hi>la Valiere.</hi> For which reaſon he was the more aſſiduous in his viſits. But Madam <hi>de la Valiere</hi> ſoon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd that 'twas not for her ſake that the King ſo frequently came to ſee her, but that Madam <hi>de Monteſpan</hi> poſſeſs'd his Inclinations.</p>
                  <p>She complain'd to the King therefore after a moſt tender manner, and the King without evaſion, and as obligingly as he could told her that Madam <hi>de Monteſpan</hi> was one of the moſt beautiful women that ever he ſaw, and that he verily believe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d ſhe had a paſſion for him. To this the King added, that ſhe had no reaſon to be ſurpris<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d at it; that the change ſhould be no prejudice to her; that he would always preſerve a particuliar eſteem for her; and that he thought ſhe had no cauſe to be diſatisfied. Madam <hi>de la Valiere</hi> melted into tears. But then, the King repeated what he had ſaid.
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:53606:229"/> He declar'd to her, that he deſir'd ſhe ſhould live with Madam <hi>de Monteſpan</hi> as ſhe had done: ſhe promis'd to do it: and indeed, ſhe liv'd with her Rivalleſs with that unanimity and concord as ſurpris d all the Court; for all the world knew that <hi>la Valiere</hi> was not the favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite Miſtreſs.</p>
                  <p>The King viſited his new Miſtriſs every moment, and becauſe the delicacy of his love could not endure that another ſhould ſhare of her favours with him, he reſolv'd to remove <hi>Monſieur de Monteſpan</hi> from her, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of advancing him to greater employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But <hi>Monſieur de Monteſpan</hi> refus'd eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing, and it happen'd alſo, ſome days after that he extreamly abus'd his Wife. Madam <hi>de Monteſpan</hi> complain'd, upon which the King exil'd the incommodious Husband, who was fain to withdraw with his Children into his own Country near the <hi>Pyrenians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He put himſelf into mourning as if his Wife had been dead: but for all that, the King ſent him a conſiderable Sum of Money, which he ſtood in great need of, as being very much in debt.</p>
                  <p>As for Madam <hi>de la Valiere,</hi> ſhe knew that the King had forſaken her, and therefore ſtrove to comfort her ſelf the beſt ſhe could, one day to which purpoſe ſhe ſent the King the following Verſes:

                  <p>The King was extreamly pleas'd with theſe Lines; and the Anſwer which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to it ſome few Minutes after was, that Kings gave thoſe Laws to Love, which Love gave to other men; and made her freſh proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:53606:230"/> of his eternal eſteem. Now in regard ſhe expected no other Anſwer, ſhe reſolv'd to put her ſelf into a Convent, and made choice of the <hi>Carmelites</hi> Nunnery, where, ſome time after, ſhe took upon her the Religious Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit.</p>
                  <p>Certain it is that Love and Deſpite had an equal ſhare in this Retirement. Nevertheleſs ſhe was willing that the world ſhould attribute it to better motives.

                  </q>
                  <p>This Retirement of <hi>la Valiere</hi> gave equal ſatisfaction to the King, and M. <hi>de Monteſpan.</hi> For after all, the Preſence of an Abandon'd Miſtriſs could not chuſe but be a continual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the Kings inconſtancy and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations of perpetual love which he had made her. On the other ſide Madam <hi>de Monteſpan,</hi> who was not unacquainted with <hi>la Valieres</hi> Genius, was afraid leſt ſhe ſhould recover the King's Affection.</p>
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:53606:231"/>
                  <p>The King had not been ſo long abſent from his new Miſtriſs, but that ſhe was big with Child, when <hi>la Valiere</hi> betook her ſelf to the <hi>Carme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites.</hi> However ſhe hid her great Belly as much as ſhe could, and was privately brought to bed of a Son.</p>
                  <p>All this while <hi>Lauſun</hi> ſtrove to comfort him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up in the Embraces of another; and correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponded only as a friend with Madam <hi>de Monteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan</hi> at leaſt to outward appearance. But this ſame friendſhip, whether counterfeit or real, laſted not long. For <hi>Lauſun</hi> and Madam <hi>de Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſpan</hi> fell out, and quarrel'd to that degree, that the King was forc'd to interpoſe and make up the buſineſs, tho' <hi>Lauſun</hi> had given out thoſe ſpeeches that were no leſs injurious to the Monarch of <hi>France,</hi> then to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of <hi>Monteſpan,</hi> and very little to his own Honour. For whatever favours a man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives from a woman are never to be boaſted of, tho' it be his ill luck to break off with her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lauſun</hi> had like to have been turn'd out of favour, but after this reconciliation, which oblig'd him to beg pardon of M. <hi>de Monteſpan,</hi> he was as great as ever with the King.</p>
                  <p>The Ambition of this Favourite was ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate, that nothing could ſatisfie it. For tho' he were but a bare Gentleman; yet he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pir'd to a Marriage with <hi>Mademoiſelle de Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſier.</hi> And indeed that Princeſs had a real kindneſs for him: inſomuch that ſhe proteſted to him, that if the King would conſent to their
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:53606:231"/> Marriage, ſhe was ready to do her part. The firſt time that <hi>Lauſun</hi> mention'd it to the King, he was extreamly ſurpriz'd: but by degrees he was wrought upon to liſten to it; and ſo many Engines were ſet at work, that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd not to oppoſe the Match; notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the diſproportion between a ſingle Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman and a Princeſs of the Blood.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lauſun</hi> was too hairbrain'd to uſe his good Fortune with moderation, and therefore committed a fault upon this occaſion, which was never afterwards to be repair'd. For inſtead of Marrying <hi>Mademoiſelle</hi> privately as he ought to have done, when the King had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven his conſent, he ſpent a world of time in making preparations for his Nuptials, and in the mean while the King alter'd his mind, at the ſolicitation of all the Princes of the Royal Family, who throwing themſelves at his feet, beſought him to break off the Match, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract his promiſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lauſun</hi> believing that Madam <hi>de Monteſpan</hi> had playd him this trick, went to her houſe, and fell a railing at her like a Tinker; he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd againſt her in all places where he came, and ſo little ſpar'd the King himſelf, that the King caus'd him to be arreſted, and ſometime after ſent him to <hi>Pignerol,</hi> where he was ſhut up in a Chamber with Iron Grates, without any Company but a few Books, and a Lackquey, who was told that if he would ſtay with his Maſter, he muſt reſolve to be as cloſe a Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as himſelf.</p>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:53606:232"/>
                  <p>Madam <hi>de Monteſpan</hi> found her ſelf very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, after ſhe was thus deliver'd from <hi>Lauſun,</hi> who was wont to teize her with ſtories very ungrateful to her Ears. The King who lov'd her as paſſionately as he had done <hi>la Valiere,</hi> had four Children by her, of all which ſhe lay in privately.</p>
                  <p>Madam <hi>de la Valiere,</hi> who had a real love for the King, a love not grounded upon any ſcore of Intereſt, never procur'd any advantage either for her Friends or her Relations. For out of an overſtraind niceneſs, and to ſhew that ſhe had a love for no man living but the King, ſhe never ſu'd to him for any favour for any of her acquaintance. Therefore Marſhal <hi>Grammont</hi> told her very well to the purpoſe one day when ſhe complain'd to him, that every body had forſaken her ſince her Rival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs came into credit, <hi>That while ſhe had an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to be merry her ſelf, ſhe ſhould have taken care to make others merry, if ſhe had had a mind that others ſhould have pitty'd her, when ſhe her ſelf had an occaſion to mourn.</hi> But Madam <hi>de Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſpan</hi> took a quite different courſe. No con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Employment was conferr'd, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her ſolicitation, and by her interceſſion. She it was, to ſpeak properly, that beſtow'd every thing, even to the very Eccleſiaſtical Benefices. She advanc'd all her kindred to that degree of Grandeur, to which otherwiſe they could never have attain'd. In ſhort, ſhe procur'd for her Brother, who was no more then the Count of <hi>Vironne,</hi> the Dignities of
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:53606:232"/> Duke and Peer and General of the Gallies, and the Battoon of Marſhal of <hi>France.</hi> Which caus'd a Perſon of the Firſt Quality in <hi>France</hi> to ſay, ſpeaking of Marſhal <hi>de la Fueiltade</hi> and her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that one was Marſhal of the Sword and the other Marſhal of the Scabbard.</p>
                  <p>Never did Miſtriſs better underſtand to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage her Lovers humour then ſhe did; and that too, when the King had not all that kindneſs for her that people imagin'd: for 'tis ſaid that Madam <hi>de Lude,</hi> who was but a<note n="*" place="margin">A Virgin that lives like a Nun, but makes no vox, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces her E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate.</note> Canoneſs of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain,</hi> frequently ſhar'd with her the favours of the French Monarch; which gave an occaſion to the following Epigram.</p>

                        <hi>Valiere</hi> was a Commoner,</l>

                  </q>
                  <p>Certain it is that <hi>la Valiere</hi> was of no very Noble Extraction. Her Enemies were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wont to ſay, after the King had made her a Dutcheſs, that 'twas but a few months ago, that ſhe was hardly a Gentlewoman: and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> who had been diſapointed by the King upon her account, never call'd her other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:53606:233"/> then the little Cittizens Daughter of <hi>Tours.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>However it were, the Canoneſs of <hi>Lorrain</hi> was the cauſe that Madam <hi>de Monteſpan</hi> ſpent many a night without cloſing her eyes. Yet this was not the Rivalleſs that caus'd the change of the Kings Affection.</p>
                  <p>At the ſame time that M. <hi>de Monteſpan</hi> thought her Affairs in the moſt ſetl'd conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that ſhe lookt upon her ſelf to be moſt ſolidly fix'd in the King s Affections, a young Damſel ſurprizingly Beautiful was preferr'd to ſerve the Mounſieur's Dutcheſs as one of her Maids of Honour. This was <hi>Mademoiſelle de Fontange,</hi> who might be ſaid to be a Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peice of Nature.</p>
                  <p>But before M. <hi>de Fontange</hi> appear'd, M. <hi>de Monteſpan</hi>'s Enemies made uſe of all their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices to ſet the King againſt her. They told him a thouſand ſtories to put him out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit with her. But all their Artifices failing; they thought there was no other way but to give him a home ſtroke upon the Conſcience<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide. The Confeſſor who ſucceeded <hi>Anat,</hi> had more wit then to undertake the Employmeut. He knew what it had coſt his Predeceſſor, and the reproaches it had brought upon that ſilly Jeſuit. However they found out a Preacher who had the courage one day in his Pulpit before the King to tell him the ſtory of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Bathſheba.</hi> 'Tis true, he ſeem'd to turn his matter another way; but all men eaſily perceiv'd what he aim d at. But after he came
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:53606:233"/> out of his Pulpit, the King ſaid the Preacher had made a very good Sermon, and away he went to viſit Madam <hi>de Monteſpan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This pious fraud not ſucceeding, it came into their heads to ſhow him ſomething of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality which might infuſe into him an Averſion and Contempt of his Miſtriſs. And the treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery of a Serving Maid gave 'em a favourable opportunity. This Maid being brib'd deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd into their hands a Billet of M. <hi>de Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſpan</hi>'s hand writing; which they counterfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo well, that by adding one ſingle word, there was a neceſſity for the King to fall into the ſnare, and to acknowledge himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayd. The Billet was given to the King as if it had been found by accident. He read it; nor was it poſſible for him to diſtinguiſh the difference of the Character. That which was added, though ſpoken after an Ambiguous manner, preſently gall'd him, and put him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch a rage, that he reſolv'd forthwith to find out the Myſtery, Away he flung to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Monteſpan,</hi> whom he found read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Courtly Novel. What! Madam, ſaid the King with a kind ofſcornful Air, have you not left of theſe trifles yet? Tis true, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed Madam <hi>de Monteſpan,</hi> that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Solidity in theſe ſort of books, and I muſt acknowledge that they are no more then the Dreams and Viſions of others that create in us either joy or ſadneſs. Nevertheleſs I am ſo weak ſometimes as to ſuffer my ſelf to be ſeduc'd, and I could not read the Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:53606:234"/> of a Miſtriſs mention'd in this little Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry without paying ſome tears to the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune of her Lover. I wonder, reply'd the King, that a thing ſo cuſtomary to your Sex, ſhould raiſe your paſſion to that degree. He went on with his diſcourſe in the ſame tune, and carry'd it on ſo far, that Madam <hi>de Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſpan</hi> began to ſuſpect ſome myſtery. Alas! Sir, ſaid ſhe, ſuch a Prince, ſo rarely endow'd as your ſelf, have no reaſon to fear any ſuch thing, had he to do with the moſt fickle and inconſtant of Women. In a word, they who poſſeſs a Merit ſo Illuſtrious as Yours, are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove theſe ſuſpicions. I ſo flatter'd my ſelf, hitherto, reply'd the King; but Kings are deceiv'd as well as other men. This Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation not a little troubl'd M. <hi>Monteſpan,</hi> who was altogether innocent of what the King believ'd her Guilty of, and therefore knowing herſelf to be free from all reproach, ſhe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd only with tenderneſs and tears. Which ſo mollifi'd the King, that without ſeeking any farther for the ſatisfaction which he deſir'd, he withdrew, after he had pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately conveigh'd the Billet into Madam <hi>de Monteſpan</hi>'s Pocket.</p>
                  <p>The King had no ſooner left her, but M. <hi>de Monteſpan</hi> pulling out her Handkerchief to wipe her Eyes, ſaw the fatal cauſe of her miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune fall at her feet. She took it up, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd it, read it, and ſoon perceiv d the ſoul play of her Enemies. Now it was of that Importance for her to prevent as ſoon
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:53606:234"/> as might be the Kings firſt Impreſſions from ſinking too deep into his mind, that ſhe went to him immediately, and having made it out to him that ſomething had been added, the King was convinc'd, and diſcours'd her with a thouſand obliging tenderneſſes.</p>
                  <p>It never could be diſcover'd who the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of this Artifice were. The Billet was ſo dextrouſly conveigh'd into the Kings hands, that 'twas impoſſible to have other then weak ſuſpicions. Some thought this Blow to have been given by Madam <hi>la Valiere,</hi> who in the midſt of the Auſterities of her Cloyſter, could not be inſenſible of her diſgrace. Others threw this Intreague upon one of the Queens Ladies of Honour; and others upon ſome of <hi>Lauſun</hi>'s friends; and the latter perhaps were not miſtaken.</p>
                  <p>One would have thought that after ſuch a ſatisfaction as this, the King ſhould not have chang'd his Affection ſo ſoon. But he no ſooner beheld Madam <hi>de Fontange,</hi> but his heart was ſmitten, and he began to make her mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Preſents. Madam <hi>de Monteſpan</hi> was alarum'd at it. She flatter'd herſelf however ſometimes that the King would not forſake her. But at length ſhe ſaw ſo much coolneſs in him, that ſhe no longer doubted but that he was altogether in love with <hi>Fontange:</hi> nor was ſhe deceiv'd.</p>
                  <p>The King who was ſmitten with her Charms from the very firſt moment that he ſaw her, commanded the Prince of <hi>Marſillac</hi> to tell her
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:53606:235"/> in his name that he had a Paſſion for her, and that he ſhould be the moſt happy Monarch in the world if ſhe correſponded with his Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs. Nor did the Prince of <hi>Marſillac</hi> meet with any great trouble in perſwading her to grant what ever the King demanded, for that ſhe was brought to the Court with no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſign but to pleaſe him. She preſently therefore made anſwer to the Prince of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſillac,</hi> that he had thoſe Powerful Attractives, that ſhe muſt be altogether Inſenſible, not to be charm'd with the Paſſion of the greateſt Monarch in the World. However, that ſhe could not rely upon what he had ſaid to her, ſo long as Madam <hi>de Monteſpan</hi> was ſtill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd; but if ſhe could aſſure her ſelf that the King had no farther thoughts of his Old Miſtriſs, ſhe might then build upon his Affection.</p>
                  <p>The Prince of <hi>Marſillac</hi> to make a quick end of the buſineſs, and to pride himſelf in the ſucceſs of his Embaſſy, told Madam <hi>de Fontage</hi> whatever could be ſaid upon the like occaſion; that the King had then no kindneſs for Madam <hi>de Monteſpan,</hi> but what was only habitual, and he ſwore and vow'd that M. <hi>de Monteſpan</hi> was utterly obliterated out of the Kings heart, and alleadg'd ſo many reaſons for it, that <hi>Mademoiſelle de Fontange</hi> acknowledg'd the Adorations which ſhe had always payd the King in her heart, nor could ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal the tranſports of her joy.</p>
                  <pb n="237" facs="tcp:53606:235"/>
                  <p>Madam <hi>de Monteſpan,</hi> who ſoon after had notice of all that had paſt, was at her wits end. She left nothing omitted to regain the the Kings Affection. And the Marqueſs of <hi>Lonvois</hi> who was one of her ſincereſt friends, advis'd her to watch an opportunity to ſpeak with the King in private. She did ſo, ſhe ſigh'd, ſhe ſobb'd, complain'd, and wept a ſhower of Tears. But all could not force from the King any more then theſe words, <hi>That he would viſit her as he was wont to do, but that a King ought to have his own Liberty.</hi> In a word, he return'd to her as he was wont to do, but always wholly taken up, with his new Paſſion.</p>
                  <p>The firſt time the King ſaw <hi>Mademoiſelle de Fontange</hi> was at the <hi>Tuilleries.</hi> At what time he had a long Diſcourſe with her, wherein he acquainted her after a moſt tender manner with his love, and told her, it ſhould be her fault, if in loving him, ſhe did not meet with all the ſweets of a moſt ſincere Correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence. <hi>La Fontange</hi> anſwer'd with an Air ſo full of diſcompoſure, that the trouble of her mind furniſh'd her with new Charms. And the King perceiv'd from that very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that her Heart was not made of <hi>Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In a word, when they parly'd, he told her, that he ſaw well her ſhamefaſtneſs and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty had hindred him from delivering to her his whole mind. After which he deſir d her to write to him; adding withall, that he
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:53606:236"/> flatter'd himſelf with having one of her Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters within a few hours, wherein ſhe would expreſs the ſentiments ſhe had for him with more freedom, then perhaps his Preſence would permit her to do.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mademoiſelle de Fontange,</hi> who had accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni'd to the <hi>Tuilleries</hi> a Lady of the Higheſt Quality in whom ſhe very much confided, and who had left her with the King, walked a while with that Lady, tranſported with joy and ſatisfaction, becauſe ſhe well perceiv'd that, the King had a real love for her. After that they took Coach together, and all their diſcourſe was about what the King had ſaid, moſt obliging, to her. And in regard ſhe told the Lady that the King had deſir'd her to write the ſame day, the Lady advis'd her not to fail; for that ſhe ran a hazard of loſing her good Fortune if ſhe did not yield him a blind obedience; and that it was high time for her to declare herſelf. And therefore, added ſhe, write immediately ſuch a Letter as Love ſhall dictate to ye. <hi>Mad. de Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage</hi> follow'd her advice; ſo that ſhe was no ſooner got home, but ſhe writ to the King as follows.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tho' the vaſt difference there is between your ſelf and me, ought to oblige me to look upon your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Addreſſes as a peice of Gallantry rather then a real Declaration of your Affection; nevertheleſs, if it be true that real lovers, when they have once beheld each other, know the moſt ſecret thoughts of their own hearts, 'twould be a vanity for me any
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:53606:236"/> longer to conceal from you, the ſentiments which I have diſcover'd in yours. I muſt acknowlege ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, Sir, that the Merit alone of your Perſon had already diſpos'd of me, before your Majeſty made known to we your inclinations. Pardon me howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, if I have ſtrove againſt this Paſſion from the firſt minute that I perceiv'd it growing in me. I did ſo, but it was not out of any reluctancy that I had to cheriſh what appear'd to me ſo aimable, only I was afraid, Sir, to diſpleaſe ye. Judge of my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination by ſo ingenious a Confeſſion of my weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It would be a difficult thing to expreſs the Raptures the King was in, after he had read this Letter. He could not forbear reading it over and over, and repeating the last words. He was ſo well ſatisfi'd with his new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, that ſome time after, he conferr'd the Office of Grand Huntſman of <hi>France</hi> upon <hi>Marſillac.</hi> Which drew upon him the following Lampoon.</p>

                     <l>The King, for ſervice ſo renown'd,</l>

                  <p>The ſme day that <hi>Mademoiſelle de Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tange</hi> wrote to the King, the Monarch went to ſee her privately, and after that was very aſſiduous in his viſits to her. Two days after, he appointed a Hunting Match where were all the Ladies of Diſtinction that belong'd to the Court, and among the reſt <hi>Mademoiſelle de Fontange</hi> made her appearance in more then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Splendor. The King never left her, and after he had given her the pleaſure of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Hunted Deer run juſt before her, they went aſide into the thickeſt part of the Wood where they ſtay'd for ſome time: and from that day forward it was that <hi>M. de Fontange</hi> ſtill found her ſelf ſomewhat indiſpos'd. She had on an Embroider'd <hi>Juſttaucore</hi> of very great value, which the King had preſented her, and wore a little flat Shepherdeſſes Hat co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd with a Carnation and white Plume of Feathers, which wrought a wonderful effect. 'Twas a moſt lovely day, but toward the evening, when the King was returning home, there was a gentle Breeze, which forc'd <hi>M. de Fontange</hi> to leave off her Hatt. After which ſhe ty'd her Head Attire with a Ribband, the Knots of which hung down a little upon her Forehead; and that ſame dreſs ſo highly pleas'd the King, that he deſir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d with their Heads dreſt after the ſame manner. And this was the Original of thoſe large Towers that Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſtill wear: a Faſhion that deriv d it ſelf
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:53606:237"/> from the Court of <hi>France</hi> over all the Courts of <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next day after the Hunting March, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Fontange</hi> was troubled with extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary pains in her head and faintings of her heart, ſo violent and ſharp that ſhe could not forbear complaining: nor would the King ſtil from her, overwhelmed with grief to ſee her in that condition. At what time all of a ſuddain caſting her Eyes upon the King, with a tender and languiſhing Utterance, <hi>Dear Prince,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>was there a neceſſity that ſuch great Pains ſhould ſo ſpeedily follow ſuch great Pleaſures? But 'tis no matter,</hi> added ſhe immediately, <hi>I love the cauſe of 'em, and ſhall do, while I live.</hi> The Paſſionate manner of her delivering theſe words rais'd the Kings Pity and his Love withall to that degree, that he Embrac'd her with thoſe Tranſports that he never had ſhown for any of his other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes. He vow'd to her that he never lov'd any one before ſo dearly as he lov'd her, and that he would love her eternally.</p>
                  <p>After the King had declar'd himſelf for his new Miſtreſs, he ſo little obſerved any Meaſures, that the whole Court knew within two Hours after, all that had paſſed upon this occaſion, <hi>Madam</hi> who had as great an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion for Madam <hi>Fontange</hi> as ſhe had for <hi>La Valiere,</hi> and who was no leſs vext to the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:53606:238"/> heart and the Soul for having ſupply'd the King with two Miſtreſſes, that had quite baulk'd her of the King's Affection, made it the ſubject of a thouſand Nipping Taunts and Jokes. Nor could Madam <hi>de Monteſpan</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear from doing very near the ſame thing. So that one Evening the King found the following Verſes under his Toilete.</p>
                  <q>

                  </q>
                  <p>The King, who had been told ſome days before, that <hi>Madam</hi> had aſſerted in Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that <hi>M. de Fontange</hi> had been guilty of Intreagues in the Province from whence ſhe came, made no queſtion but the Verſes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from her hand, on of ſome of her Friends. Upon which he declar'd that the affront touch'd him ſo much the more to the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:53606:238"/> quick becauſe the Attack was made upon his Miſtreſſes Honour, the moſt ſenſible part of a woman. On the otherſide M. <hi>de Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tange</hi> deſir'd Juſtice to be done her for the Calumny that was thrown upon her; and preſently let fall a deluge of Tears. But the King told her the beſt Juſtice he could do her was to deſpiſe the Lampoons and Satyrs of her Enemies, and ſhe agreed and Satyrs that 'twas the beſt courſe they could take; wherein ſhe acted very prudently.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the King refus'd no favour that <hi>Mademoiſelle de Fontange</hi> deſir'd of him. She could but ſpeak and have, and more then that, ſhe obtain'd what he refus'd to ſeveral Princes. He grunted Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to the greateſt part of her friends, and conferr'd upon one of her Siſters the Abby of <hi>Chelle,</hi> very conſiderable for the yearly Revenue. And that new Abbeſs was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcecrated with that Pomp and Magnificence, as it would be a difficult matter to deſcribe. The Ceremony was honour'd by a great number of Prelates, almoſt all the Court was preſent, and M. <hi>de Fontange</hi> appear'd with ſo much ſplendor, that ſhe drew up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her the Eyes of all the Spectators as much as the Abbeſs who was conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                  <pb n="244" facs="tcp:53606:239"/>
                  <p>The faintings of the Heart which Madam <hi>de Fontange</hi> complain'd of, continu'd till ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd herſelf to be big with Child; which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blig'd the King to confer upon her the Title of Dutcheſs, as he had done upon <hi>la Valiere,</hi> and to provide her a Houſe; for the maintenance of which he allow'd her a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand Crowns a Month. But in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard ſhe was extreamly liberal, the Duke of <hi>Nouailles</hi> was made choice of to regulate her Expences, to the end the Sum might hold out. And then, they began to call her Madam.</p>
                  <p>So ſoon as Madam <hi>de Monteſpan</hi> was fully convinc'd that ſhe was to make room for her Rivaleſs, ſhe began to think of retiring, and gave it out openly. 'Twas thought at firſt, that ſhe would have encreaſed the number of the Nunns at <hi>Fonterault,</hi> becauſe ſhe had made ſome journey's thither, but ſhe never had any thoughts of confining her ſelf to ſuch a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy Life. She withdrew indeed, but was ſo far from removing from the Court as her Predeceſſor had done, that ſhe tarri'd there, paid her Viſits as ſhe was wont to do, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der d her Affairs after ſuch a manner, that ſhe had always ſome little ſhare in the Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net Intreagues. This Retirement was better underſtood then Madam <hi>de la Valieres,</hi> but ſhe had reaſon without doubt for what ſhe did. However it were, the King forbore not his Viſits to <hi>Monteſpan</hi> but went to ſee
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:53606:239"/> her ſometimes, which made her give out that her Credit with the King was ſtill greater then ever it was. That the King's Love for <hi>Fontange</hi> was but a Tranſitory unſteady Affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from which he would recall himſelf as ſoon as he did from that which he had for Madam <hi>de Lude,</hi> which laſted but for a few days; laſtly that ſhe had reaſon to believe that her Lover would return to her again, more enamour'd then ever he had been: her Favourites alſo and Friends at Court endeavour'd to give a Reputation to theſe Reports. But the more cleare-ſighted finding that the King abandon'd himſelf wholly to Madam <hi>de Fontange,</hi> began to ſeek her favour, who ſtill procur'd great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments and advantages to thoſe for whom ſhe had a kindneſs.</p>
                  <p>Madam <hi>de Monteſpan</hi> who ſaw that no body could be ignorant any longer of the Kings ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Affection for his new Miſtreſs, became ſo highly exaſperated, that ſhe began to rail againſt it openly; which very much offended the King.</p>

She fell into ſuch a Conſumption that they who knew her before, hardly knew her when they ſaw her; which was ſtill attended with ſuch a Flux of Blood, that every body gave her over for loſt. All people believ'd her to have been Poyſon'd, and all people accus'd

                     <hi>Monteſpan.</hi> So far were all the Remedy's from doing her good, that her languiſhment conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd every day. The King Viſited her duly, and manifeſted after a moſt tender manner the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of his Grief, to ſee her reduc'd to that condition. But in regard ſhe knew there was no cure for her Diſtemper, ſhe beſought the King that ſhe might retire from the Court, adding, with tears in her Eyes, that ſhe had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more to do in this world but to prepare herſelf for Death.</p>
                  <p>The King who was ſenſibly touch'd and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order'd by his being preſent with her in her affliction, granted her Requeſt. Thereupon ſhe retir'd into a Convent in St. <hi>James</hi>'s Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burbs, where the Duke of <hi>Fueillade</hi> went to Viſit her from the King two or three times a Week. But in a little time after ſhe dyd, leaving after her death more viſible marks of her being Poyſon'd, then were to be diſcover'd during her ſickneſs, by the report of the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The King's Grief was ſo extream, that he could not refrain from ſhewing it; and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that he had taken his revenge upon Madam <hi>de Monteſpan</hi> after a more then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary manner, had he not had prevailing Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to diſſemble his Reſentment. For he was fully convinc'd that Madam <hi>de Fontange</hi> had been ſacrific'd to the Jealouſie and deſpair of that Ambitious Woman, who had flatter'd herſelf that ſhe ſhould ſtill enjoy the King's
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:53606:240"/> Affection. In the mean time to let the world ſee that he was really ſorry for the loſs of <hi>Fontange,</hi> and that the Eſteem and Tenderneſs he had for her was not extinguiſh'd by her Death, he gave a rich Abby to one of her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, marry'd one of her Siſters to great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and did an infinite number of other things in favour of her Family; which did not a little mortifie Madam <hi>de Monteſpan,</hi> who imagin'd, that ſhe being deliver'd from her Rivaleſs, the King might take a new Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to her. But ſhe deceiv'd herſelf. The King never went to ſee her but upon a Politick Accompt: and reſolv'd for the future to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all manner of Amorous Intreagues.</p>

'Twould be a hard matter to expreſs the joy of that Princeſs, when the underſtood from the King's own Mouth, that <hi>Lanſan</hi> was at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, nor the Extaſies ſhe was in when he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd at <hi>Paris.</hi> However he did not lodge in her Houſe, tho' he were permitted to go when he pleas'd to ſee her: So that he was wich her from Morning till Night. This Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity continu'd for ſome Month's; and Madam <hi>de Montpenſier</hi> was ſo charm'd with him, that ſhe ſettl'd upon him two conſiderable Lordſhips, with the King's conſent.

<pb n="249" facs="tcp:53606:241"/> Monſieur <hi>de Lauſun</hi> fail'd not to meet, and the Lacquey, who waited for him at the Church door, carry'd him to a Houſe that was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to him. Preſently he underſtood the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery. The Lady receiv'd him bluſhing, but immediatly recovering herſelf, ſhe told him, that being endow d with ſuch extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Qualities, he ought no to wonder that others made the firſt advances, and that ſhe ſhould eſteem her ſelf happy if ſhe had not been ſo forward in vain. The Lady had ſo much wit and ſo many Charms, that M. <hi>de Lauſun,</hi> who never dreamt of ſuch good Fortune, ſtood like one in a Trance. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing recover'd from his ſurprize, he ſpoke as the Lady deſir'd, and ſwore a thouſand Oaths that he had been enchanted with her Perſon above ſix Weeks together, but that the profound reſpect he had for all Perſons of her Sex, and for thoſe eſpecially that held that Rank in the world as ſhe did, had kept him from declaring his Paſſion. Some days after <hi>Lauſun</hi> gave the Lady a Viſit. But <hi>Mademoiſelle,</hi> who was become extreamly jealous and watch'd him where ever he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  <p>It may be ſaid that <hi>Lauſun</hi> was got clear of one dreadful Priſon to be confin'd to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother mo leſs loathſome for in ſhort he had no longer any kindneſs for <hi>Mademoiſelle,</hi> but
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:53606:242"/> there was a neceſſity for him to live in tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon more then one account. He was at his wits end with his unhappy rate. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he was reſolv'd to torment himſelf, and to ingage himſelf no more in Amorous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treagues.</p>
                  <p>This Reſolution laſted for ſome Weeks, and <hi>Mademoiſelle</hi> was proud of her ſelf, that ſhe had fix'd him at length. Never had he appear'd ſo full of Paſſion, nor ſo affectionate to her. The Princeſs never ſtept a ſtep, but <hi>Lauſun</hi> follow'd her. He was with her at her upriſing, and he never parted from her till Midnight; and he ſhew'd her ſo many teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of his tenderneſs, that a Perſon more quick fighthed then <hi>Mademoiſelle de Montpenſier</hi> might have been perhaps deceiv'd. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he had an utter Aveſion againſt her, and whatever Reſolution he had taken to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the Charmes of any new Inclination, he could not forbear falling in love with a Young Dutcheſs next to whom he ſat in a Box at the Repreſentation of an Opera. He told her without any more ado that he lov'd her. The Dutcheſs hearken'd to him and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the moſt intimate friends in the World. But he was ſoon croſs'd in his Amours by the Jealouſie and Reproaches of <hi>Mademoiſelle:</hi> ſo that he found himſelf conſtrain'd to quit his Conqueſt, which brought upon him a Terti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Ague that held him two Months before he could be cur'd. He had recourſe to an <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi>
                     <pb n="251" facs="tcp:53606:242"/> Phyſitian, and three times taking the <hi>Quinquina</hi> rid him of his troubleſome Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion. But the ſame remedy could not cure him of his diſguſt of <hi>Mademoiſelle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Jealouſie of that Princeſs made ſuch a noiſe, that all the whole Court knew the Count of <hi>Lauſun</hi> had had three or four Miſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes within the ſpace of five or ſix Months. Inſomuch that the King could not forbear laughing, and ſaying at the ſame time, that he could not but pitty his Kinſwoman, whom he had told a thouſand times what would befall her; <hi>Lauſan</hi> being a meer Shatter braines.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mademoiſelles</hi> Enemies rais'd a thouſand ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries about him, which render'd her ridiculous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>Lauſun,</hi> for his part became the ſubject of all the Town-Raillery. But that which was the greateſt vexation to him was this, that it got him ſo ill a repute among the Lady's, that there was hardly a Chambermaid would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit his Careſſes for fear of his <hi>Mademoiſelle.</hi> The Young Widow that he fell in Love with firſt of all, and who was almoſt diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed becauſe the Count had forſaken her, ſell upon him one Evening before a great deal of Company, and play'd upon him ſo cruelly for his Inconſtancy, and about his Ague, the marks of which a Wit as he was, he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay for himſelf. Thereupon he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd ſo ill ſatisfy'd with himſelf that he had return'd no better anſwers to the Lady's
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:53606:243"/> Raillery, that he went and vented all his Spleen upon <hi>Mademoiſelle,</hi> where he commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted two or three abſurd actions, and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue took him again the ſame Night. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he return'd to his <hi>Quinquina;</hi> but his Ague being fix'd, his touchey humour became Inſupportable.</p>
                  <p>But as <hi>Mademoiſelle de Montpenſier</hi> had brought upon herſelf ſo many Mortifications, ſo neither was Madam <hi>de Monteſpan</hi> exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from 'em. For the death of her Rivaleſs had no way render d her condition more eaſie. 'Tis true the King made her frequent Viſits; but they were cold, and to little or no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and at length ſhe perceiv'd that the King took more delight in the Company of Madam <hi>de Maintenon,</hi> who was Governeſs to his Children, then in Hers. In a word M. <hi>de Maintenon</hi> was the Woman in whom the King put all his confidence. So that Madam <hi>de Monteſpan</hi> was again at her wits-end. For in regard it was ſhe who had made the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what ſhe was, ſhe could not endure that the Work or her own hands ſhould prove ſerviceable to her deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>The whole Court was no leſs ſurpriz'd then Madam <hi>de Monteſpan</hi> to ſee the King ſo aſſiduous to a Woman of whom a thouſand ſtories had been told, and who was known by moſt People to have been no better then <hi>Scarron</hi>'s Widow. But the King loves Wit where ever he meets with it; and every body
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:53606:243"/> knows Madam <hi>de Maintenon</hi> to be infinitely Witty above the common rate of her Sex, and that there is no Intreague ſo difficult which ſhe is not able to carry on.</p>
                  <p>The firſt time that Madam <hi>de Monteſpan</hi> ſaw her, ſhe ſoon perceiv'd what ſhe was capable of: ſo that without any heſitation, ſhe retain'd her in her Service; and that Crafty Woman underſtood ſo well how to inſinuate herſelf into her good liking, that ſhe entruſted her with all her Secrets<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhe ſaw all the Letters that Madam <hi>de Monteſpan</hi> wrote to the King, and all thoſe which the King wrote to her. And when Madam <hi>de Monteſpan</hi> was at a loſs, how to compoſe a Letter, Madam <hi>de Maintenon</hi> did it for her, and had incomparable ſucceſs. One day ſhe wrote one for the Counteſs, with which the King was enchanted. The King knew well that it was above his Miſtreſſes Genius, and and therefore would needs know who wrote it. Should I tell yee reply'd Madam <hi>de Monteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan,</hi> you would hardly believe it. But not to hold ye any longer in ſuſpence, I do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt to ye Sir, that it was Miſtreſs <hi>Scarron</hi> who dictated to me. I had ſuch a cruel pain in my Head that day, and your pleaſure was ſo abſolute that I ſhould return you an anſwer, that I was forc'd to have recourſe to her Aſſiſtance. From that very day the King had a great deſire to ſee her, and he was ſo well ſatisfy'd with her Converſation, that
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:53606:244"/> he told her a thouſand pretty things the moſt obliging in the World. At the ſame time he recommended her to Madam <hi>de Monteſpan</hi> to take particular notice of her, and took ſuch particular cognizance of her himſelf, that he purchas'd for her the Signiory of <hi>Maintenon,</hi> which acquir'd her the Title of Marchioneſs: and a <hi>Herald</hi> had order to fetch her deſcent from <hi>Jone d' Albret</hi> Queen of <hi>Navarr,</hi> who after the death of her Husband, marry'd privately with one of her Gentlemen, who pretended to be the Father of Madam <hi>d' Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bigny,</hi> Madam <hi>de Maintenon</hi>'s Grandfather.</p>
                  <p>However it were, for many People ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd againſt this Pedygree, Madam <hi>de Maintenon</hi> found herſelf of a ſuddain to be both the King's Confident and Favourite, and the only Conſolation of that Monarch after the death of Madam <hi>de Fontange.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Madam <hi>de Monteſpan</hi> did all ſhe could to put the King out of conceit with her; but hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto nothing has ſucceeded. The King has ſuch a value for her, that he does not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain to conſult her ſometimes in the moſt Tickliſh Affairs of State: and as things now ſtand, the King would rather quarrel with the whole Royal Family then with her. Nevertheleſs, ſhe has often undergone moſt Terrible Mortifications. But ſtill the King's favour has upheld her in the midſt of theſe petty Anguiſhes of her Mind, to which the Joys of great People and Favourites are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:53606:244"/> ſubject. She has had ſeveral Letters deliver'd to her that have ript up all the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences of her Life. Among the reſt that which follows was one that was diſper'd up and down by her Enemies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tis the wonder of the World, Madam not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding you are mounted to ſo high a Pinacle of Favour, that you ſhould ſo little know your ſelf. We may very well apply to you the Tale of that vile Aminal, which carrying the Relicques of a Deity, thought it had been himſelf to whom the People pai their Adoration, and nor the Idol with which he was laden. A little conſideration of what you were would do you a great deal of good. 'Tis requiſite to put you in mind of it; for you look as if you had quite and clean forgot it. All the World knows Madam, that when Monſieur</hi> Scarron <hi>talk'd of Marriage all his friends laugh'd at him. They told him that for ſuch a Decrepit Creature as he was, to Marry, was to liſt himſelf in the Family of</hi> Acteon, <hi>and that becauſe they ſhould not reproach him with any thing of that nature, he made choice of a cracke Veſſel. By good Fortune</hi> Scarron <hi>lit upon your ſelf; he marry'd ye Publickly, which made him ſay very wittily, that they could not lay it in his diſh, that his weakneſs was the cauſe of his Wives Wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and no doubt but he was in the Right. As he was a man of Wit and Sence, be left yee to your own Conduct; and all the World knows how you behav'd yourſelf. Should the Good Man return from the other world, how heartily would
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:53606:245"/> he laugh to behold your Metamorphoſis. And as he was a Man of a good humour, I make no queſtion but he would bring ſuch an Action againſt the King, as would puzzle the Parliament, who could not but do him Juſtice, and ſentence you to quit Royal Honours, and reaſſume your old Titles of</hi> Miſtreſs <hi>and</hi> Gooddy <hi>ſuch an one. Adieu,</hi> Beldam; <hi>take my advice and remember what you were, I give you wholſome Counſell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Madam <hi>de Maintenon</hi> was not much puzzled to know from whence the Letter came, ſo ſfoon as ſhe had read it. She burnt it in cold Blood, as ſhe did all the reſt of the ſame nature which ſhe receiv'd, without making the leaſt complaint to the King: and for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that were ſo full of grating particulars, ſhe ſhew d 'em to her Monarch to make him ſport; and thoſe ſort of Confidences, tho' in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they were but Trifles, never fail d of ſucceſs. In a word Madam <hi>de Maintenon</hi> has manag'd her buſineſs ſo well, that ſhe tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs over all thoſe that envy'd her. The King has a friendſhip, a value, an eſteem for her, and ſhould the Monarch dye before her, ſhe has an apartment in St. <hi>Lewiſe</hi>'s Houſe at St. <hi>Cyr,</hi> where ſhe is to reſide as long as ſhe lives, and to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain d, with all the Perſons that belong to her Traine, by the Revenues belonging to the Foundation of that Houſe; and to enjoy all the Honours due to a Foundreſs. Care is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo taken to canonize her before hand; for
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:53606:245"/> notwithſtanding all the Inventions of Oblo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quy, ſhe has met with Panegyriſts who have made it out, that tho' <hi>Scarron,</hi> who marry'd her at Sixteen Years of Age, made choice of her to ſolace and refreſh his Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight, and to diſcourſe with her when he had no other Company, rather then for any Carnal Society, yet the indiſpoſition of her Husband was no injury to her Virtue. They have own'd, that thoſe Perſons who fell in Love with her, were not the Richeſt, or of the beſt Quality in the Kingdom, yet that ſhe has merited a univerſal Eſteem among all Men, for the prudence of her Conduct, and that ſhe ought to have this Juſtice done her, that ſhe obſerv'd a fair Conjugal Amity without practiſing the Principal Actions that belong to it.</p>
                  <p>As for Madam <hi>de la Valiere</hi> and Madam <hi>de Monteſpan,</hi> they have as much reaſon to be ſatisfy'd as Madam <hi>de Maintenon.</hi> It may be ſaid, that when they were Favourites, the King idoliz'd 'em; and tho' he grew weary of 'em at length, he never forgot that they had been his Miſtreſſes. Both the one and the other have been always lookt upon with diſtinction, and the Children which the King had by 'em have been advanc'd to Dignities and Matches the moſt Illuſtrous in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.

                  <p>'Tis not to be expreſs d what Reſpect the whole Court is oblig'd to give to the Kings Natural Children, even the Princes of the Blood are conſtrain'd to do the ſame; which Poſterity will hardly believe. One day that the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> was diſcourſing with ſome Courtiers, the Duke of <hi>Maine,</hi> who was then very Young, and ſome other Noblemen s Children of the ſame age made ſuch a noiſe, that they interrupted their diſcourſe, which was very ſerious, ſo that the Prince was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain d to bid the Children be quiet. Which the Duke of <hi>Maine</hi> hearing made anſwer, that he thought his Highneſs had not been afraid of noiſe, he that had made ſo much in the world. Immediately the Prince went and repeated theſe words to the King, with the ſame gaye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to outward appearance, as if he had been to have repeated ſome witty Expreſſion or genteel Act of the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> Nay, the Prince finding it was a Courſe which of neceſſity it behov'd him to take, carryed his deference a little farther: for when he went to the Count of <hi>Vermandois,</hi> to let him know how much he was pleas'd with the Marriage of M. <hi>de Blois</hi> his Siſter to the Prince of <hi>Conti,</hi> he durſt not preſume to take an Elbow Chair that was preſented him, but ſat him down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Plain Chair, becauſe the Count made uſe of ſuch another.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs all theſe deferences cannot hinder the whole Court from making private Comments and Cenſures upon theſe odd kind
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:53606:247"/> of mixtures, which is the reaſon that many are turn'd out of favour.</p>
                  <p>In a word, they who have beſtow'd the higheſt applauſes upon the King, have not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born to ſay, that it has been one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt defects of this Monarch to intermix the Blood of <hi>Bourbon</hi> with that of <hi>la Valiere</hi> and <hi>Monteſpan.</hi> And indeed, altho' the Princes and Princeſſes who are the Iſſue of the King's Amours, are Perſons of great vertue and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it, theſe Alliances can never be juſtified. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, if we conſider it never ſo little, the King could not diſpence with doing as he has done. For certain it is, that under a new Reign, when there is generally a univerſal change of the Face of affairs, the Duke of <hi>Maine,</hi> would have been but little valued had he not Marry'd <hi>Mademoiſelle de Charolois,</hi> or ſome of her Quality. Therefore 'tis meerly out of Policy, wherein Natural Affection has been only liſten'd to, that the Blood of <hi>la Valiere</hi> and M. <hi>de Monteſpan</hi> has been mix'd with the Royal Blood of <hi>Bourbon.</hi> And whatſoever may be ſaid againſt it, there was in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect a certain Generoſity of the King, which balances the Irregularity of theſe Matches.</p>
